3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.400
Hyungnim, have some ginseng.

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.510
- It will help with your cold.
- Yes.

5
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.000
Cold?

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.520
Yes. Hyungnim was in snow.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.900
Snow? It snowed today?

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.720
It snowed for a short time and I got something called the cold.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.760
Your body isn't the type to get a cold...

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.410
Is that so? Hey, Zombie, do you want to die? You told me it was a cold.

11
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.590
It is a cold.

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.190
You had a slight fever after being snowed on and you said your throat itched.

13
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.910
Since I'm already dead, I can't catch colds, but I definitely remember getting them.

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.190
Anyway, I don't feel all too well because of this cold.

15
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.020
If I drank warm sake, I would have been better.

16
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.320
Are you sure you have a cold?

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.590
A cold is a pretty minor disease.

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.770
Is there a possibility that it could be a more serious disease?

19
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.580
No.

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.920
That's disappointing. But I guess a sickness is a sickness.

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.170
Why? Are you happy that I'm sick?

22
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.810
Of course, I'm happy.

23
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.520
So happy that it's the reason you've been flashing winks at me for the past few minutes?

24
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.870
This is a side-effect and it's all because of you.

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.620
It's hideous to see. Sorry.

26
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.110
For comfort, do you want me to follow you? Huh? Huh?

27
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.140
Hey, Jin Bu Ja, you do it too.

28
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.640
Okay.

29
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.960
But, recently my eyes keep falling out so I can't wink well.

30
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.620
Then, should I...

31
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.480
Don't do it!

32
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.940
Alright. I won't do it.

33
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.440
It will get better soon.

34
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.130
Something very joyful is going to happen.

35
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.190
What joyful event?

36
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.670
Some work-related things. That being said...

37
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.180
I'm planning on inviting someone over to this house.

38
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.170
Whom are you inviting?

39
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.050
He is an American movie director. He is a very smart and gentle human.

40
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.910
But then to invite humans, I'm going to need a human's help.

41
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.450
I also plan on inviting Sam Jang over.

42
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.200
It's okay, right, Great Sage?

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.850
Do whatever you want.

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.310
Let's invite them together so they can meet.

45
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.370
<i>Do you remember me?</i>
♪<i> To you I am the setting sun</i>

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.930
<i>Yes.</i>

47
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.240
♪<i> Like the sunset</i> ♪

48
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.690
♪<i> I will become a part of a beautiful memory</i> ♪

49
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.110
Look forward to it also, Great Sage. It's going to be very interesting.

50
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.110
Ma Wang, do you want me to punch your eye?

51
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.630
No thanks. My eye will get better soon.

52
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.010
You worry about your eye.

53
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.030
Now I can do it!

54
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.890
But I can't open my eyes!

55
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.340
You made me lose my appetite for the soup!

56
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.430
Bu Ja, your eyes have rolled back into your head.

57
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.630
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.150
Why do my eyes keep falling out and rolling back into my head?

59
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.190
You see, why would you tell a zombie to wink?

60
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.390
Do you intend on making her eyes roll back into her head?

61
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.550
A corpse that should be lying down with its eyes closed but is instead winking it's eyes is living in luxury.

62
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.480
- Yes, I'm living a luxurious life.
- Zombie, come over here.

63
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.360
I'll hit the back of your head so we can reinsert your eyeball after it falls out. Come over here.

64
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.630
I look hideous when my eyeball falls out. I look like a zombie!

65
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.820
Hey, a zombie should be like a zombie. Hey, come over here!

66
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.780
Hey, hey. Come here. I'll hit you just once. Come here, Zombie!

67
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.200
That nut job of a monkey.

68
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.120
Soon, from your two eyes,

69
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.950
I will make you shed bloody tears of jealousy.

70
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.380
Soon.

71
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.160
Did you ask what you've been wanting to know during the time that the Geumganggo was frozen?

72
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.790
<i>Son Oh Gong, what I want to know is...</i>

73
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.130
<i>am I pretty right now?</i>

74
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.090
<i>Yeah, you're pretty.</i>

75
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.850
<i>Because I love you.</i>

76
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.780
At that exact moment, out of all times, it stopped snowing.

77
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.550
They were like his usual words, but at the same time not.

78
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.690
What were they like?

79
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.770
Usually he says, "Because I love you."

80
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.540
But during that time, he did this, "Because I love you."

81
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.710
- They are the same.
- They aren't!

82
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.460
Someone who used to say "Because I love you"

83
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.430
said, "Because I love you". This is what he did!

84
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.170
I'm more confused because I needlessly asked you.

85
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.200
There's nothing to be confused about.

86
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.500
My brother can't freeze the Geumganggo. I am stronger.

87
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.540
What good is it if the Winter General freezes it if the Summer Fairy melts it at the same time.

88
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.550
Then both of you were teasing me?

89
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.270
General Winter and Summer Fairy. To a demon brother and sister pair, I got played?

90
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.590
That is why should hang out with humans, not demons.

91
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.670
There's no one who suits me.

92
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.870
If there were someone like that, I would have also liked a human.

93
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.190
Still, is that a reason to like a demon?

94
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.690
Who likes a demon?

95
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.860
Jin Seon Mi, don't be confused

96
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.700
and please find a person you can love.

97
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.730
If you keep getting your heart stolen by a demon, it becomes dangerous.

98
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.810
That's right. Getting my heart stolen is dangerous.

99
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.890
- What's dangerous?
- You scared me!

100
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.700
- If it was dangerous, why didn't you call me?
- Why are you here if I didn't call you?

101
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.120
I came because I wanted to see you, of course. I also have something to give you.

102
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.940
You got snowed on. Eat warm porridge before you sleep so you don't catch a cold. Sa Oh Jeong made it.

103
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.480
You're saying someone who makes cell phones made porridge for me?

104
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.420
My Oh Jeong loves to cook. If you eat deliciously for him, he smiles so cutely.

105
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.020
Tell your younger brother that I will eat it deliciously.

106
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.200
Tell him yourself. If you open the lid and talk, Sa Oh Jeong can hear you.

107
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.000
Really?

108
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.630
I'll it eat well. Thank you, Sa Oh Jeong.

109
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.030
- He isn't replying.
- Is he in the middle of a phone call? Leave a message.

110
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.360
- A message?
- Yeah!

111
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.290
Or would you like to make a video call?

112
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.600
- You're teasing me right now, aren't you?
- Of course.

113
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.790
You're an idiot. You believed that

114
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.750
I mean, is a thermos a cellphone?

115
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.070
- Are you having fun teasing a human?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.660
Now it should work. Give it a try.

117
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.900
Forget it. I'm going to use a phone.

118
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.020
Because I'm a human, I have to use this. After hanging out with someone like you,

119
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.890
I keep getting confused and do ridiculous things.

120
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.760
You're mad because I tried to kill you, aren't you?

121
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.430
What is there to be mad at? I'm an idiot.

122
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.310
The strongest predator who can eat me is you.

123
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.290
Since you're too friendly as a predator, I was confused into thinking I was safe.

124
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.720
Is that so? I've become sure.

125
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.900
I couldn't leave you to disappear.

126
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.200
Before then, my heart will break into pieces.

127
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.730
So, you're not going to die. Unless I do.

128
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.270
Because of the Geumganggo?

129
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.760
Yeah.

130
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.760
You don't have to worry anymore. You're safe Sam Jang.

131
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.060
It's the truth, so trust me.

132
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.470
How can I trust you when you're always conning me?

133
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:29.630
Eat something warm, sleep well, and if you have something to say, leave a message.

134
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.680
Are you trying to trick me again? I don't believe you!

135
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.670
Oh, he left.

136
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.730
What am I looking forward to?

137
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.970
<i>Am I pretty now?</i>

138
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.670
<i>Yeah, you're pretty.</i>

139
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.720
<i>Because I love you.</i>

140
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.600
That was all fake. I won't be fooled.

141
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.820
I'm also sure now.

142
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.150
I won't believe anything! I will never, ever believe anything!

143
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.760
<i>You're lying while you truly believe.</i>

144
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.990
<i>Jin Seon Mi, when you were young and even now, you get fooled too easily.</i>

145
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.160
I'm hanging up!

146
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.090
Let's not get fooled. If I get bewitched by a demon, it's dangerous.

147
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.330
<i>- Where are you?
- At the library.</i>

148
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.270
<i>Nobody's here at this hour. It's awesome.</i>

149
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.850
<i>[Don't you know about the school library rumor? They say a ghost appears there]</i>

150
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.460
<i>Ghost?</i>

151
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.590
<i>[It's scary so that's why nobody goes there. You should hurry home, too.</i>

152
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.250
What a joke.

153
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.660
<i>Why is she looking at me?</i>

154
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.600
<i>There's no ghost here.</i>

155
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.220
<i>But a really pretty girl is here!</i>

156
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.870
You moved quite fast.

157
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.760
<i>They say the library ghost is really pretty...</i>

158
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.740
<i>And... that she has no legs.</i>

159
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.350
What are you doing?

160
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.570
<i>Look over here.</i>

161
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.880
<i>The monsters of rivers are this way</i>

162
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.440
Are you the one who called me?

163
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.130
I'm the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Jade Dragon.

164
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.670
How did you end up here?

165
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.730
First get me out of here.

166
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.010
I will escort you, prince.

167
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.170
The octopus in here is the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea?

168
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:32.040
Yes, he was punished and was caught in a net when he had lost his demonic powers.

169
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.370
I quickly placed him in here and escorted him

170
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.870
from the fish market where he could've been sold for sushi.

171
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.140
He is sleeping right now.

172
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.350
They said Jade Dragon got kicked out after selling medicine to mermaids that turned them into humans.

173
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.660
He really showed up in this state.

174
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.850
Ma Wang and the Dragon of the East Sea are close friends so why don't you take him in?

175
00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.160
I will take my leave as there is an urgent meeting for me to attend.

176
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:07.310
Taking in a monkey and a zombie is already too much for me.

177
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.480
Adding this octopus is overdoing it.

178
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.370
Why don't you take care of it?

179
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.980
Then I will take my leave, as I have a golf appointment.

180
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.260
One moment! You have to take it in!

181
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.790
Who's going to take this in? Ma Wang! Wait!

182
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.580
Ma Wang!

183
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.080
Why can't I audition for the upcoming movie?

184
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.380
Alice, you're acting is crappy.

185
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.540
I will speak directly with Chairman Woo Hwi.

186
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.610
That will not do.

187
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.260
Then, shall I barge into his house?

188
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.490
Please wait a moment. I'll speak to the Chairman.

189
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.640
Should I kill her?

190
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.480
Oh my. The prince has escaped.

191
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.240
I'm so pissed off.

192
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.780
How dare she say the word "crappy" to me?

193
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.670
What is this? This is an octopus tentacle.

194
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.870
Oh my! Oh my! Go away!

195
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.990
Go away! Get lost!

196
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.300
- Alice?
- Yeah.

197
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.300
You're not Alice.

198
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.970
<i>Did I get caught?</i>

199
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.010
Are you the prince?

200
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:44.010
That's right. I'm the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Jade Dragon.

201
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.840
Why don't you put your legs together. Gosh.

202
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.440
Jade Dragon, return to the sea.

203
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.910
I'll explain the situation well to your father.

204
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.940
I can't go back now. I have to find something.

205
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.840
When I have found it, I will return this body to its owner.

206
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.490
You can't carelessly walk around in that body.

207
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.360
Why? Is there a problem with this body?

208
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.390
For a human, isn't a pretty decent body?

209
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.900
Geez!

210
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.500
She doesn't smell. She seems healthy.

211
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.880
Stop it. That body is our agency's precious celebrity.

212
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.350
She's famous. If you do that in front of others, it's the end.

213
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.500
Did I choose the wrong one?

214
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.500
I can't move into another body for a while.

215
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.760
Alice has an important commercial shoot this morning, what should we do?

216
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.400
I'll do it.

217
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.660
In return, the person I'm looking for, you find her.

218
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.910
Hey, Secretary Ma. Place Jeo Pal Gye to assist him and get through the schedule.

219
00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.610
I'll go look for Sam Jang.

220
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.220
Will you be alright?

221
00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.890
What if you suffer side effects?

222
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.890
I can overcome them.

223
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:12.320
CEO, do you really have nothing going on between you and Secretary Son?

224
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:17.030
Yes, there's nothing. He simply protects me.

225
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:21.830
Then by any chance, would you like to try going on a blind date?

226
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:28.720
My junior who came by the office last time eagerly asked me to introduce you to him.

227
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.920
Would it be okay with you if you introduced me to your junior?

228
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.420
He was the chairman of mystery fairy tales. He totally loves scary things.

229
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.330
He has a stable job.

230
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.710
He's a really smooth guy, just like this coffee.

231
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.390
He's way better than that good for nothing Secretary Son. Oh my gosh!

232
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.160
What's the matter?

233
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.200
What's mysterious these days is

234
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.200
that bad things happen whenever I say bad things about Secretary Son.

235
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.990
Out of nowhere, things fall, chairs slip out from under me.

236
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.720
You almost got hurt.

237
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.380
You're listening, right?

238
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.590
Don't play jokes in here again.

239
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.980
Mr. Lee Han Joo,

240
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.960
in the future, don't say bad things about him even when he's not present.

241
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.600
It's dangerous.

242
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.870
Yes.

243
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.960
Ah, CEO...

244
00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:42.600
About that blind date, I think it'd be better to not to do it. You're busy.

245
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.710
If he is a man as smooth as coffee, I wanted to meet him at least once.

246
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.490
Oh, my wife, I'm really scared.

247
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:13.010
I was a bit scared but just a moment ago, I was really scared.

248
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.480
Should I just quit?

249
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.700
Hold on.

250
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.270
- Hello.
- Hello.

251
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.580
Today, you came here personally.

252
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.930
Yes, there is an important matter to take care of.

253
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.760
- Does my CEO have an important event today also?
- Yes.

254
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.890
But, she's not appearing on television. What kind of event is she participating in?

255
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.870
This time it's

256
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.980
an important event related to a member of the royal family who has traveled from far away.

257
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.470
- A banquet for VIPS?
- Well, you could say that.

258
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.010
I understand.

259
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.070
Then, I'll be going.

260
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.350
Please enter.

261
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.260
Hello?

262
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:21.070
Wifey, Chairman Woo Hwi is acting very friendly towards me.

263
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:27.500
I think I should continue working here. We have to think of Han Byul's future too.

264
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.830
The son of the Dragon King came to find a mermaid?

265
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.980
Yes, they say he sold medicine that makes legs appear

266
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.480
to a mermaid who was in love with a human.

267
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.050
Why do you keep doing that?

268
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.770
It's a... small side effect.

269
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.630
One moment. Geez.

270
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.080
I'm sorry.

271
00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.380
All we have to do is find that mermaid and send her back to the sea.

272
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.740
If it's a mermaid, she's a monster. Can a monster love a human?

273
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.370
It's not impossible. You're also receiving the love of a monster.

274
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.180
That's fake love that originates from the Geumganggo.

275
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.360
You're not confused and are accurately informed.

276
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.770
That's fake, yes.

277
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.800
Because Sam Jang is human, it's natural that she receives love from a human.

278
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.200
Love like that doesn't exist.

279
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.190
What if it did exist, what would it be like?

280
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.990
If there was someone who loved you,

281
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.350
would you be able to love him back?

282
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.870
Of course. If there's anyone who says they like me, please introduce them to me.

283
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.060
So I can try my hand at dating.

284
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.600
Then, please find the mermaid.

285
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.730
I'll find a human for Sam Jang.

286
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.250
If Sam Jang dates,

287
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.230
someone's heart will be torn to shreds.

288
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.630
He didn't come to rescue a mermaid but to kill a human who betrayed her?

289
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.250
He said to give this knife to the mermaid when you find her.

290
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.920
A mermaid who can't earn the love of a human can't return to the sea safely.

291
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.380
She must stab the human's heart with that knife so she doesn't disappear.

292
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.600
If Ma Wang who keeps talking about becoming a deity knows, he won't help find the mermaid.

293
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:45.130
Yes, that's why the Dragon King's son has already asked me.

294
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:49.180
If you find the mermaid and give her this knife, she will give you a Shingiryu.
<i>[Mermaid's tear that allows a realistic virtual reality experience]</i>

295
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.570
Ah, a Shingiryu?
<i>[Mermaid's tear that allows a realistic virtual reality experience]</i>

296
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.130
But I don't particularly have anything I want to try with that.

297
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.530
What about alcohol?

298
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.540
You'll be able to drink it as if you were doing it for real.

299
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.000
Oh Jeong, I better catch that mermaid immediately. Where do I have to go to catch it?

300
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.710
I already found out what kind of water a mermaid would play in.

301
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.630
If you choose the right bait, you will be able to catch the mermaid easily.

302
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.670
- Bait?
- Yes.

303
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.770
To catch a monster, there's no better bait than Sam Jang.

304
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.950
Hey, you just...

305
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:29.110
Our lucky bundle, Oh Jeong! Aw, you're so cute.

306
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:33.620
Right. The bait is Sam Jang.

307
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.250
Oh? Why are you here?

308
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.450
To find the mermaid together with you.

309
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.100
I can do that alone.

310
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.690
I told you, didn't I? If you're in the slightest bit of danger,

311
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.240
my heart is in danger.

312
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.590
You're making a big deal.

313
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:58.920
They say the mermaid resides in this school. Was there anyone suspicious? Anything not working out well in the vicinity?

314
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.550
I just got here. They say the human the mermaid loves is inside this school.

315
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.200
For certain, she'll be in his vicinity.

316
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.730
Then, quickly start walking around the area. The bait has to move around so the fish can bite.

317
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.620
Bait?

318
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.430
Bait? Who? You?

319
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.780
Who said you're bait? Ma Wang?!

320
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.070
What a bad rascal of a bull! How dare he speak so carelessly!

321
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.300
Who does he think he's kidding? Seriously!

322
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.680
<i>A world that is opened by a book</i>

323
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.930
The person the mermaid loves is the librarian here.

324
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.310
It must be him.

325
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.650
I guess she must be hanging around him.

326
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:54.510
We'll set up camp here and if you're here, she'll come.

327
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.020
That mermaid even abandoned the sea she used to live in.

328
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.400
Why wasn't she able to receive that man's love?

329
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.440
She must have lost her love to a human.

330
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.410
Did you eat?

331
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.810
No, let's go to a cafe.

332
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.420
- You have to eat, what do you mean by a cafe?
- Let's drink coffee.

333
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.810
Ah, I see.

334
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.160
Someone who likes that man appeared on the scene.

335
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.150
If she's watching from nearby, she must want to die from heartbreak.

336
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:28.160
You're wrong. She probably wants to kill him.

337
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.910
Would she be able to kill him even if she loves him?

338
00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.640
She shouldn't have started this kind of love from the beginning.

339
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.290
Do you feel sorry for the mermaid?

340
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.440
Then what about me?

341
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.750
You?

342
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.540
I'm also in the same position.

343
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.680
I shouldn't have started this kind of love from the beginning.

344
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.340
Ugh, my head hurts.

345
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.800
As expected, the energy from these books doesn't suit me.

346
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.200
If anything suspicious shows up, call me.

347
00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:23.250
What happens if Sam Jang ends up loving a different human man?

348
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.650
That rascal's heart will probably be torn to pieces.

349
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:32.290
Since Jonathan accepted my invitation, things are going according to my plan.

350
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.960
If it's according to your plan, Jonathan will soon get to meet his first love, Jin Seon Mi.

351
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:44.270
That's right. While the two people are reuniting, I will make sure Son Oh Gong will be watching from one side.

352
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.130
Watch.

353
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.770
Like from behind a pillar. Like this.

354
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:57.380
It comes out often in dramas, hiding behind a pillar or a wall, looking so miserable.

355
00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.160
Like this. Crying.

356
00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.050
Just the thought of seeing that image

357
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.690
is so satisfying.

358
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.510
But, will he be able to recognize Jin Seon Mi whom he saw as a child?

359
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.160
Of course he won't be able to so I have to let him know in advance.

360
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.980
That I found the little kid, his first love.

361
00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.750
It may be certain, but it isn't romantic.

362
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:34.070
If I just let them meet and they don't recognize each other, there will be a failure in my plan.

363
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.660
If the two are destined for each other, isn't a fated meeting possible?

364
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:45.050
Secretary Ma, you've watched too many dramas. How is such a meeting possible?

365
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.740
The Chairman will be entering soon.

366
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.760
Yes, thank you.

367
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.930
Ah, before then, I have a favor to ask.

368
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.850
Not long ago in a park, I took a nice photo.

369
00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:10.420
I saw the person in the photo at this company.

370
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.130
I want to give you the photo.

371
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.240
Do you think you can find her?

372
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.260
- This person...
- Jonathan, the woman that appeared in the photo at Jamulsae Park...

373
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.290
Are you still searching for her?

374
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.700
Yes, because the pictures came out so nice there.

375
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.770
Can you find her?

376
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:50.120
Of course. I'll give you her business card.

377
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.620
Thank you.

378
00:29:55.030 --> 00:30:03.170
Ma Wang, between a fated meeting and a planned meeting, which one do you prefer?

379
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:08.750
Naturally, I prefer my planned meeting. That's more certain.

380
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.230
Yes, I understand.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.530
Sometimes, she's like that.

384
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:32.390
Then, please give her these photos.

385
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:38.550
Yes. I can't guarantee that she'll come soon so I can't ask you to keep waiting.

No, that's alright.

388
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.290
One moment.

389
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.910
Yes, hello. Yes.

Yes, yes, yes. I'm Lee Hanjoo. Yesterday I...

I mean, what?

Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd ever see her again.

403
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.890
And here she is, right in front of me.

It's destiny.

- Destiny.
- Sorry. I don't understand.

- You speak English slow...
- No, no, no.

Destiny! She's my destiny! Don't you get it? This is amazing!

PK, Alice.

418
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.430
Yes!

419
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.570
I'll prepare for filming.

420
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:43.040
Over there, if you see someone wearing a name tag that says staff, be friendly no matter what.

421
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.010
Are they the powerful people here?

422
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:53.700
That's right. Also, if you start filming, eat well and smile well. You just need to do those two things.

423
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.470
Eat well and smile well. I'll do my best.

424
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.460
Gosh! Don't do that!

425
00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.170
This is my first in a human woman's body. It doesn't fit here.

426
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.100
It's uncomfortable here.

427
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.740
Jeez.

428
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.010
I think I wore my undergarment incorrectly.

429

What's wrong with this? Check the lights!

430

Did you just do that?

431
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.650
This isn't even your body.

432
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:53.670

Pig, what kind of relationship do you have with this woman?

434

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:22.100
Oh, look. By any chance, does this woman like that guy?

439
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.190
Oh my, you confessed your love to PK?

440
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.820
<i>Damn it! It was a woman's body that liked the pig!</i>

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.700
<i>I'm ruined! Ruined! Pig! Gosh, that pig!</i>

Hyungnim, you have only one drinking experience using the Shingiryu.

443
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:55.060
Be prudent about selecting which alcohol you will drink.

444
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.900
I don't have any doubts. I will drink warm sake.

445
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.400
Ah, yes.

446
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.100
Then, I will prepare the best side dish to compliment the sake.

447
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.450
Seafood would be good, don't you think?

448
00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:12.040
No, no. It's only once. Strong soju would be good.

449
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.930
For soju, a stew would also make a good side dish.

450
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:20.280
Makgeoli. <i>[Fermented rice wine]</i> I've liked makgeoli since a long time ago.

451
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.510
Okay. Makgeoli. Decided.

452
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.910
With Makgeoli, one should eat scallion pancakes.

453
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.600
I like pizza better than scallion pancakes.

454
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.880
For pizza, beer is the automatic choice.

455
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.480
That's right it's beer!

456
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.450
Hey, zombie! Because of you, I was making a difficult decision and my heart wavered!

457
00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:41.400
You've been wavering for a while so why are you blaming me?

458
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.880
Since I have to decide on a very important matter, just go inside the fridge.

459
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.990
Sa Oh Jeong made kimchi so it's packed full.

460
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.360
Did you put kimchi in there? Where do you expect her to stay?

461
00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:00.220
These days, the weather is cold so the balcony is colder than the fridge.

462
00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:05.920
Hyungnim, you don't have to make a decision right away so please think about it prudently.

463
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.580
Whiskey, ah tequila.

464
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:17.310
Son Oh Gong, why are you using such a good opportunity to drink?

465
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.490
If it were me, I would see someone I really miss.

466
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:26.710
Hey, your brain is rotten so you don't even remember who you miss!

467
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:33.270
Even though I don't remember, I'm certain that there was someone I missed.

468
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.760
Because I was a person.

469
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.790
The people you miss will probably not like it when they see you.

470
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:40.250
Because now, you're not a person.

471
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:44.100
Zombie. You are a zombie.

472
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.810
How dare you look at me like that?! Hey, at that rate, you might bite!

473
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.570
Fine. Bite me! Bite me!

474
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.090
Just try and bite me. I'll burn everything up.

475
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.510
- Oh Jeong.
- Yes.

476
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.790
Let's go with my first choice, warm sake.

477
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.420
For sake, barbequed skewers are also nice.

478
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.210
- Barbequed skewers!
- Eels are better than skewers.

479
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.650
With eels, you have to drink soju!

480
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.780
Hey, Zombie! I should just...

481
00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.580
Gosh, I got confused again!

482
00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:02.270
<i>When a mermaid gets hit by water, she will reveal her true identity.</i>

483
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.540
It's you.

484
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:32.270
He said if you get hit by water, a tail would emerge. Why don't you even have legs?

485
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.550
Stop right there.

486
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.030
♪ Catch it. Where could it be?

487
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.610
I caught it.

488
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.370
He came.

489
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.320
Son Oh Gong.

490
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.720
- Just a moment ago, that was the mermaid, right?
- Yeah.

491
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.550
But why doesn't she have legs or a tail?

492
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:13.260
I don't know. In any case, I finished my task.

493
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.920
Let's go.

494
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.120
- You're finished?
- Is she going back to the sea?

495
00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.950
She said she would take care of it.

496
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.760
It looked like you gave her something. What is it?

497
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:30.430
Something that a friend from the sea relayed to her. Now she will make the decision.

498
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.720
By chance, it's not dangerous, is it?

499
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.720
To whom? To humans?

500
00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.170
If she is going to harm humans, we have to stop her.

501
00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:44.160
I don't want to. Why would I?

502
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.700
I've finished my task so I'm leaving.

503
00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.340
<i>[CEO]</i>

504
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.000
CEO, why aren't you answering the phone?

505
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.220
Your friend kept waiting for you.

506
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.300
What friend?

507
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.770
<i>He said he was a childhood friend.</i>

508
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.890
I don't have any childhood friends.

509
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.720
One moment, I'll put him on the phone.

510
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.670
Please take the phone.

511
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.710
Thank you.

512
00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.860
Seon Mi?

513
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:47.690
<i>If she sees that from nearby, she'd probably want to die from heartache.</i>

514
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:53.160
<i>Wrong. She'd probably want to kill him.</i>

515
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.330
No way.

516
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.100
Hello?

517
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:21.080
I gave that knife to that mermaid. Give me what you promised.

518
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.320
What do you mean by knife? You didn't return her to the sea without making a fuss?

519
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.270
She already couldn't return without creating a fuss.

520
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.110
What trick did the two of you play?

521
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.370
What happened to the mermaid?

522
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:38.030
Because a mermaid's love is unconditional, she sacrifices everything.

523
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:44.260
She gives everything to the ever selfish human and gets discarded.

524
00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:51.600
I came to relay the knife used to stab the heart of that traitor.

525
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.490
You rascal. You dared to use me to harm a human?

526
00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:03.510
Don't rush to get angry. Anyway, that mermaid can't harm a human.

527
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:04.790
What?

528
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:11.400
I told you. That mermaid was already in a state where she is unable to return without making a fuss.

529
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.390
The mermaid was already dead.

530
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.180
What is this?

531
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.840
- Who are you?
- You killed that woman, didn't you?
- What is that?

532
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.630
What's that? Wasn't she a human?

533
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.320
- No, a mermaid.
- A mermaid?

534
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:17.080
No wonder. She was so obedient, I thought she was dim-witted.

535
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.200
She wasn't a human?

536
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.160
Then I'm not a murderer anymore.

537
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.490
The mermaid will punish you.

538
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:34.230
The idea that a mermaid will forgive everything, turn into bubbles and get lost is a fairy tale made up by humans.

539
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.270
You are...

540
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:11.700
That's a thorn that will stay stuck in your heart forever to give you pain.

541
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.930
Now you'll be able to return to the sea.

542
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.510
Since he didn't kill a human, it won't be a huge problem.

543
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.600
Even if it does become a problem, please overlook it.

544
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:08.000
That rascal of a monkey did it without telling me to get a Shingiryu.

545
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.800
The Great Sage, after meeting a mermaid who was betrayed by a human,

546
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.200
must really not feel like drinking.

547
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:21.650
Would that selfish rascal lose his appetite for drinking because he feels sorry for the mermaid?

548
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:27.430
That rascal. That incident from long ago probably resurfaced for him.

549
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.950
By that incident, you mean...

550
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:39.810
Son Oh Gong that rascal also got used by a human and was badly betrayed.

551
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:45.500
That arrogant rascal was punished for that incident and was trapped in Five Elements Mountain.

552
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.960
He must have been tormented for several hundred years.

553
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.970
He got played while putting on airs.

554
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.000
Miss Jin Seon Mi?

555
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.720
It's the first time having both of you here.

556
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.570
Quickly, take a seat.

557
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.700
You knew about it all along, didn't you? Why didn't you tell me?

558
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.840
- Because I'm a human, you thought I would try to stop the mermaid from exacting her revenge?
- Yeah.

559
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.480
Humans are selfish and can't be trusted.

560
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.670
Son Oh Gong, earlier you asked me if you and that mermaid were both pitiful in the same way, right?

561
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:51.230
It's not the same. I don't feel pity for you at all.

562
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:56.890
Because I like being with you.

563
00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:01.670
Even if your feelings are fake, I'm thankful and glad that you love me.

564
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.620
It's the truth.

565
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.140
The human who got stabbed probably said the same thing as you in the beginning.

566
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:20.520
That's right. Because humans can't be trusted, I also think that I can change.

567
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:26.950
If I ever only use you and betray you, you can also stab me.

568
00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:31.060
I told you, didn't I? You can't die until I die.

569
00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:37.020
Then I'll take off the Geumganggo. If I take it off, nothing will happen to you.

570
00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.810
Stab me.

571
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.290
A contract.

572
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.190
We need to sign a contract?

573
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.390
Why? You want to look like a trustworthy person but don't want to take the responsibility?

574
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.400
That's sneaky.

575
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.280
I mean, it's burdensome.

576
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.720
We shouldn't really let an incident occur that ends in a stabbing.

577
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.910
I'm saying just in case. Just in case.

578
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:14.820
If you could have a realistic virtual experience, what do you want to do?

579
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.820
I miss them, but can't see them. So I would want to see them.

580
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.980
You don't have anyone around you, who do you miss?

581
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:28.120
My grandmother. Since I can't see my maternal grandmother again,

582
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:33.090
I want to go back to when I was young and meet grandmother.

583
00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.420
It's the whiskey you always order.

584
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.850
I'm sorry for drinking by myself.

585
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:46.540
Don't worry about it. I'll have a chance to drink soon, too.

586
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:53.090
Whiskey would be nice as well.

587
00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.160
You waited a long time but you couldn't see her. What are you going to do?

588
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.870
I couldn't see her today. There's tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

589
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.830
Okay, see you the next day.

590
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:15.290
Also, I need some important information.

591
00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:22.340
Does Seon Mi have a boyfriend?

592
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.740
<i>Get lost.</i>

593
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.620
- No.
- Good.

594
00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.420
- Good.
- Great.

595
00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.800
- Good.
- Thank you.
- Okay.

596
00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.640
Alright.

597
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:43.240
If you escaped and tried to harm a person,

598
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:48.360
I really wouldn't have left you alone. Since this incident passed by smoothly,

599
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.390
now return to the sea.

600
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.190
Secretary Ma.

601
00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:03.160
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by
The Monkey Minions @ Viki</i>

602
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.450
It's nice.

603
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:12.060
Now, come out of Alice's body and get inside this.

604
00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.860
I will safely escort you to the East Sea.

605
00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.440
The water is too dirty.

606
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:23.020
- Change it to mineral water.
- Yes.

607
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.360
I still can't go.

608
00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.320
Why? Why? Why? WHY?!

609
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.670
That knife is a treasure from the dragon castle.

610
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:34.260
Also I stole a Shingiryu. If I go, my father will kill me.

611
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.330
I can't go.

612
00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.630
I'll be in your debt for the time being.

613
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.290
That...!

614
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.460
Should I kill her?

615
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.930
He's the son of the Dragon King. He also has to film a commercial.

616
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:58.780
Let Pal Gye take care of him for the time being. Gosh, seriously!

617
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:05.070
Are you upset? Shall I report to you some good news?

618
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:06.180
What is it?

619
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:11.220
The love between Sam Jang and the man you intended for her has already started.

620
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.350

Yes, I dreamed a really nice dream. It felt so real.

By any chance was it about a pig? Don't you have to by a lottery ticket?
