1
00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.279
Grandfather.

2
00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.080
Please allow me to...

3
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:22.820
make a bow to you...

4
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:27.890
as your eldest grandson, Eun Cheon.

5
00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.190
(Episode 19)

6
00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.599
What's happening?

7
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.500
They've been in there for an hour without speaking a word.

8
00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.899
What are they doing in there?

9
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.069
My gosh.

10
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.190
What are you up to?

11
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.390
Let's say that you are Soo Man's son for the sake of the argument.

12
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.629
For past 20 years,

13
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.000
you have kept your silence.

14
00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.629
Why are you telling me this now?

15
00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.870
Grandfather,

16
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.069
for me to make a bow to you...

17
00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.940
Don't you address me as your grandfather without my permission.

18
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.780
I needed time to prepare.

19
00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.979
What have you been preparing?

20
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.750
When I revealed myself as a son born out of wedlock,

21
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.949
I needed power...

22
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.990
to protect myself and endure the trouble.

23
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.430
As you know, I am...

24
00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.560
in charge of eliminating people born out of wedlock.

25
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.060
So I thought about a way...

26
00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.530
how I could survive without being eliminated as one of them.

27
00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.799
I figured out a way...

28
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.569
and prepared for it.

29
00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.440
It took me 20 years.

30
00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.109
And are you saying what you prepared deserves my attention?

31
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.849
That's for you to decide, sir.

32
00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.599
(Information on Chairman Jang Kook Hwan's Illegal and Legal activities)

33
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.069
(Information on Chairman Jang Kook Hwan's Illegal and Legal Activities)

34
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.479
What an ungrateful, piece of trash.

35
00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.979
Are you threatening me now?

36
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.009
Yes, sir.

37
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.359
What a shameless moron.

38
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.129
According to you, I'm your grandfather, and you're my grandson.

39
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.299
Even if you haven't been properly raised without a father,

40
00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.729
how dare you threaten me, your grandfather?

41
00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:55.770
Don't you dare...

42
00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.199
call me your grandson without my permission, sir.

43
00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.299
What?

44
00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.470
I will be back tomorrow morning.

45
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.440
Address me as your grandson...

46
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.280
after you accompany me to Cheong A Hospital...

47
00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.180
and run a DNA test. It won't be late to address me as your grandson then.

48
00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.479
If the DNA result proves that you carry my lineage...

49
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.220
and I change your surname to Jang,

50
00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.789
are you going to get rid of this then?

51
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.960
Sir.

52
00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.630
If you think I've collected...

53
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.400
all this information...

54
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.900
just to be one of the Jangs for all these years,

55
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.299
don't you think I would be disappointed?

56
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.939
My gosh, look at this jerk.

57
00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.679
Then what do you want?

58
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.580
Please give me the shares of Cheong A Bio.

59
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.820
What?

60
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.689
I'm not asking you to just give me a handout.

61
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.450
I plan to pay for them.

62
00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:53.260
You must tell the president of the bank...

63
00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.330
to allow me to take out loans.

64
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.729
Are you telling me to come up with the money,

65
00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.929
so you can buy the shares?

66
00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.470
If you sell part of Cheong A Bio's shares...

67
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.369
15 percent cheaper than its original price,

68
00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.169
if possible, I would like to...

69
00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.710
buy the entire shares, sir.

70
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.880
In the end,

71
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.939
you want to acquire Cheong A Bio's shares,

72
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.080
so you can take over Daeil Distribution.

73
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.150
What will you do if I don't agree to it?

74
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.320
I will disclose cases...

75
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.859
which the statute of limitation...

76
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.530
has expired to the press.

77
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:31.700
And for those that haven't expired,

78
00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:35.200
I will hand them over to the prosecution, sir.

79
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.570
Grandfather, it's me.

80
00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:41.840
Put these away for now.

81
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.189
Why are you in Korea right now?

82
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.169
Grandfather.

83
00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.369
I came because I had something to tell you.

84
00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.470
If you don't hear it today,

85
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.640
I thought you'd be even more furious later.

86
00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:19.880
As the acting chairman and vice chairman,

87
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.410
I have made my first appointment.

88
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.479
I reinstated Yeo Cheon as the vice president of Cheong A Bio.

89
00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:27.989
As it was an urgent matter,

90
00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:31.460
I am reporting this to you after it has taken place. I'm sorry.

91
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:36.390
Hey, Boo Cheon.

92
00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:37.900
Yes?

93
00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:39.400
Do you want to be...

94
00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.369
the vice chairman only for day? Do you want to lose your job?

95
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.570
Grandfather.

96
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.369
Even Seong Man made his first appointment...

97
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.070
after serving as the president for three years.

98
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.939
How dare you appoint a vice president...

99
00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.880
on your first day as the vice chairman?

100
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.450
Attorney Kang.

101
00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.479
I told you not to keep things from me.

102
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.549
Why didn't you report this to me?

103
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.520
I'm sorry, sir.

104
00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:06.919
My gosh, look at this jerk.

105
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.729
You don't have enough patience to work at the lumber camp.

106
00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:11.760
How dare you coax Boo Cheon to transfer you out?

107
00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.669
I want to fire you right this minute.

108
00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:17.869
I'm going to let this slide since you're in the limelight.

109
00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.039
For the next three years, the right to appoint employees...

110
00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.340
belongs to me! Did you understand?

111
00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:23.809
Yes, sir.

112
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.179
Yeo Cheon.

113
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.380
Take the first flight out of Seoul.

114
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.410
Grandfather.

115
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.919
Sir.

116
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.160
The public has...

117
00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.830
its eyes on Cheong A Group's Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon

118
00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:47.299
who is competent and a breath of fresh air.

119
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.340
He exercised his right to appoint an employee as the vice chairman.

120
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.640
If you revoke his appointment,

121
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.410
no one...

122
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.109
will follow his decisions...

123
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:00.749
from this point on.

124
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.280
In addition, when people find out that...

125
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:06.780
he's just a puppet...

126
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.849
and you have all the reigns of authority,

127
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.460
the reformation of Cheong A...

128
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.960
for disbanding Strategy Team and having President Jang...

129
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.289
to take a step back...

130
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.260
would go up in smoke, sir.

131
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.470
If I let you come back,

132
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.169
can you swear to me that you won't ever cause trouble...

133
00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:28.470
for Cheong A?

134
00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:30.070
Yes, Grandfather.

135
00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.809
As long as you don't send me back to the lumber camp,

136
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.280
I will work for Cheong A as if my life depends on it.

137
00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.419
I cannot just take your word for it.

138
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.650
There must be a plan to prevent it happening again.

139
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.020
How about welcoming him back...

140
00:08:44.819 --> 00:08:47.160
with the condition of selling all of his shares from Cheong A...

141
00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:49.589
and leave Cheong A...

142
00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.559
if Director Jang Yeo Cheon causes trouble again?

143
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.770
Okay.

144
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.240
If you are ready...

145
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.010
to sell your shares and live a life without Cheong A,

146
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:09.380
stay in Cheong A Bio.

147
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.980
I am, Grandfather.

148
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.219
Thank you for giving me a chance.

149
00:09:35.969 --> 00:09:37.110
Attorney Kang, thank you...

150
00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:39.280
for helping me get out of the lumber camp.

151
00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.549
Attorney Kang.

152
00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:50.020
If you hadn't helped me back there,

153
00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:52.390
I would have gone straight to the airport.

154
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.160
It wasn't for you.

155
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.189
I wanted to respect...

156
00:09:57.959 --> 00:09:59.500
Boo Cheon's first order...

157
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.900
whatever it was.

158
00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:05.770
Let's say...

159
00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.610
you were lucky.

160
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.280
He's such a show off.

161
00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:45.780
Were you looking for me, Mom?

162
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.780
Yes.

163
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.850
It was your first day.

164
00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:54.289
I'm curious to hear how being a vice chairman was like.

165
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.120
I also wanted to tell you...

166
00:10:57.589 --> 00:10:59.089
how you should be now...

167
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.130
that you're a vice chairman.

168
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.730
In three years,

169
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.329
you'll finish being the acting chairman...

170
00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.030
and vice chairman...

171
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.000
and become the official chairman...

172
00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:14.709
of Cheong A Group.

173
00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:15.870
I told you...

174
00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:18.679
I'll take care of it myself.

175
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.150
I'm...

176
00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:28.890
the acting chairman...

177
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.959
with the strongest power...

178
00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:34.929
to even fire Pil Joo.

179
00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:37.900
Lately...

180
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.370
why do you hate Pil Joo so much?

181
00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.100
Without him...

182
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.069
I wouldn't have become a vice chairman.

183
00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:48.370
But...

184
00:11:49.569 --> 00:11:50.980
I'm the vice chairman now.

185
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.910
Jang Boo Cheon.

186
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.480
You must remember it.

187
00:11:58.319 --> 00:11:59.319
You...

188
00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:01.689
and Pil Joo too.

189
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.559
(Ms. Han)

190
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.039
The chairman wants you over.

191
00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.309
Let's hurry up before Grandfather arrives.

192
00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:30.709
I'm...

193
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.140
going to skip breakfast today.

194
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.480
We're going to celebrate me becoming a vice chairman.

195
00:13:41.549 --> 00:13:42.549
Grandfather...

196
00:13:43.219 --> 00:13:46.760
prohibited me from entering Mooshimjae.

197
00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.730
He won't be happy to see me.

198
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.799
Why didn't you tell me?

199
00:13:54.929 --> 00:13:56.299
Why did he do that?

200
00:13:58.439 --> 00:13:59.900
I'll tell you later.

201
00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:01.910
You should go ahead.

202
00:14:05.439 --> 00:14:06.480
Don't worry.

203
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.880
I'll take the responsibility. Let's go.

204
00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:26.429
Mo Hyun.

205
00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:28.600
- Grandfather... - Mom.

206
00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:32.240
If you tell her to leave, I'm going to leave too.

207
00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.929
I'll call Mooshimjae and Pil Joo.

208
00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:06.500
What about Grandfather?

209
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:08.610
He left this morning.

210
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.469
This morning?

211
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.640
Where did he go?

212
00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:15.510
He told me not to tell anyone.

213
00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:18.850
Tell Pil Joo to come.

214
00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:20.919
He went out with Chairman Jang.

215
00:15:23.719 --> 00:15:24.760
Oh, my goodness.

216
00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:28.189
He told me not to say it either.

217
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.049
(Kim Sang Cheol)

218
00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:55.350
(Lee Tae Wan)

219
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.699
I'll wait here.

220
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.199
Bring me the result as soon as it comes out.

221
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.539
You can't tell anyone about this.

222
00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:16.240
- Do you get it? - Yes.

223
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.039
That's why I used assumed names for the blood samples of...

224
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:21.179
you and Attorney Kang.

225
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.650
Okay. Let's say he and I are here today...

226
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.890
- for a medical checkup. - Yes, sir.

227
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.299
Attorney Kang.

228
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:40.299
Give me your phone.

229
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.469
You could call someone outside...

230
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.039
and do something weird with the blood sample.

231
00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.780
(Power off)

232
00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:12.999
How long is it going to take?

233
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.300
It takes about eight hours, sir.

234
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.870
Okay.

235
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.040
You know well because you've done it a lot.

236
00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:37.719
Mom.

237
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.630
Why is Grandfather doing that to Mo Hyun?

238
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.429
He told her not to enter Mooshimjae.

239
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.400
Grandfather's concerned about...

240
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:53.640
your position outside.

241
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.410
He...

242
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.410
wants to show that you're happy...

243
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.080
with Congressman Na's daughter.

244
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.150
Don't worry...

245
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.919
we won't make you divorce.

246
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.219
He only forbids her from entering.

247
00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:28.810
Mo Hyun.

248
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:33.209
I'll drive you today.

249
00:18:33.709 --> 00:18:34.850
Why?

250
00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:37.179
Just because.

251
00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.919
I feel like doing that today.

252
00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:41.949
Is it because of Grandfather?

253
00:18:44.489 --> 00:18:47.529
If he was going to do something, he would've done it already.

254
00:18:49.489 --> 00:18:51.999
Nothing happened until now, Boo Cheon.

255
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.900
Grandfather...

256
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.499
changes his mind every minute.

257
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.969
You must always be careful.

258
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:42.709
Mom.

259
00:20:43.739 --> 00:20:45.140
You're here.

260
00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:48.009
Have you been out today?

261
00:20:48.009 --> 00:20:49.150
No. Why?

262
00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:52.179
The front door was open.

263
00:20:52.249 --> 00:20:55.320
I closed it after Doo Hyun left.

264
00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:56.949
That's weird.

265
00:21:27.449 --> 00:21:31.419
(Mr. Kang Pil Joo)

266
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.580
Sir,

267
00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.650
Attorney Kang...

268
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.719
He is your grandson.

269
00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:12.259
Leave us alone for a while.

270
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.459
Yes, sir.

271
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.269
(Cheong A Hospital, DNA Test Results)

272
00:22:25.239 --> 00:22:27.779
(Out of 16 DNA fingerprints, 16 matches.)

273
00:22:31.219 --> 00:22:32.919
Did you stay around Boo Cheon...

274
00:22:33.249 --> 00:22:35.820
intentionally since the car accident?

275
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.160
Sir.

276
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.620
From the moment...

277
00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:44.029
you sent me to jail for Boo Cheon...

278
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.529
to the day I was released,

279
00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:51.340
I had no idea...

280
00:22:51.439 --> 00:22:53.499
that my biological dad belongs to the Jangs.

281
00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.439
My foster father...

282
00:22:58.979 --> 00:23:01.050
fell seriously ill,

283
00:23:01.709 --> 00:23:05.050
so I left home with a gangster to make money for his medicine...

284
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.489
and came to meet with Boo Cheon.

285
00:23:19.429 --> 00:23:21.570
It must cost a lot of money.

286
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.410
I remember the day clearly...

287
00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:37.050
as it was Soo Man's memorial day.

288
00:23:38.979 --> 00:23:40.249
Boo Cheon didn't...

289
00:23:40.249 --> 00:23:42.749
take after his dad's cleverness, so I was worried...

290
00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:45.959
and scolded him. Then he left with my car.

291
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:49.790
Goodness.

292
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.229
Maybe, Soo Man helped me to meet...

293
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.199
both of his sons, you and Boo Cheon.

294
00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.999
I guess I should take it that way.

295
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:04.910
Sir,

296
00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:07.880
I'll give you a day.

297
00:24:09.749 --> 00:24:11.979
I need you to give me an answer...

298
00:24:13.449 --> 00:24:16.219
regarding Cheong A Bio shares I asked for...

299
00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:18.090
before banks open tomorrow morning.

300
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.989
You're unbelievable.

301
00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.390
Are you interested only in shares?

302
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.400
Wait,

303
00:24:25.929 --> 00:24:27.870
is this why you made me...

304
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.900
invest my shares in Daeil Distribution?

305
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.509
Please transfer...

306
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.310
some of Cheong A Bio shares you have...

307
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.810
to Daeil Distribution...

308
00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:41.150
that Boo Cheon owns.

309
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.580
That will strike the balance...

310
00:24:45.949 --> 00:24:48.150
of power within Cheong A Bio.

311
00:24:49.419 --> 00:24:51.259
Yeo Cheon manages it...

312
00:24:51.459 --> 00:24:52.919
while Boo Cheon owns it.

313
00:24:54.689 --> 00:24:55.689
Great.

314
00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.259
Sir,

315
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.229
it took me 20 years...

316
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:03.330
for me to make a bow to you...

317
00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:08.570
as Eun Cheon.

318
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.509
Does that imply...

319
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.939
that you could've done anything...

320
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:14.449
during that period?

321
00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:23.249
Is there any progress with Alzheimer's medicine?

322
00:25:23.249 --> 00:25:25.390
To release the Alzheimer's antibody medicine...

323
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.060
to the market by 2020,

324
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.259
we're making our utmost efforts.

325
00:25:31.459 --> 00:25:32.900
The market size...

326
00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.330
of the Alzheimer's medicine...

327
00:25:41.469 --> 00:25:43.310
Don't worry, Mr. Lee.

328
00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:46.840
Vice President Jang and we are...

329
00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:49.150
on the same side now.

330
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.779
Please go on, Mr. Lee.

331
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:52.979
I will.

332
00:25:54.489 --> 00:25:56.550
The market currently involves 400 million dollars.

333
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.689
However, it's expected to grow up to 1.4 billion dollars.

334
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.060
Attorney Kang left with the chairman.

335
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.590
Goodness.

336
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.029
I was told not to tell anyone about this either.

337
00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:12.340
Thank you.

338
00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:14.040
Let's call it a day.

339
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.209
Okay.

340
00:26:23.509 --> 00:26:24.679
Boo Cheon,

341
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.850
are you all right? What's the matter?

342
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:28.919
Well...

343
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.719
There's something that bothers me.

344
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.330
Pil Joo left home early in the morning with Grandfather,

345
00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:40.900
and he kept their destination secret.

346
00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.070
He doesn't answer my phone calls either.

347
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:46.969
Pil Joo is someone...

348
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.040
who never does useless things.

349
00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.209
This is what my dad says...

350
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.009
whenever we talk about Pil Joo.

351
00:26:59.949 --> 00:27:03.949
What kind of scheme are you up to this time, Pil Joo?

352
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.290
Boo Cheon,

353
00:27:09.459 --> 00:27:10.660
you didn't forget...

354
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.830
my advice that Pil Joo might dislodge you to take your post,

355
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.400
did you?

356
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.739
We need to draw up a plan to get rid of Pil Joo.

357
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.410
Actually, I have an idea...

358
00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:31.519
Why are you all eyes?

359
00:27:32.179 --> 00:27:33.279
Yeo Cheon,

360
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.820
if I have to take care of Pil Joo in the end,

361
00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:38.719
I'm the one who decides...

362
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.489
how and when...

363
00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:42.860
to do so.

364
00:27:44.959 --> 00:27:46.699
I need your help...

365
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:49.469
only when I ask you for it.

366
00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:51.499
Understood?

367
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.110
Well, Boo Cheon...

368
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:56.709
I got it.

369
00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.209
I'll give you full support when you're ready with your plan.

370
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.759
What brings you here?

371
00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:21.130
I pestered your dad to come here with me...

372
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:24.100
because I wanted to see you working here again.

373
00:28:24.999 --> 00:28:26.140
And looking at you in your office,

374
00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:28.769
I feel relieved.

375
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.479
Come on, Mom.

376
00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:34.509
You know this is where I belong.

377
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.279
I went to the farm just to make some brownie points with Grandfather.

378
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.249
Do not reveal your intention...

379
00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:43.489
and just do as Boo Cheon wants for a while.

380
00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:46.590
You know how emotional Boo Cheon is.

381
00:28:47.219 --> 00:28:49.130
Talk up everything he does,

382
00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:52.400
then he'll willingly give you anything.

383
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.029
Try to hold on a little longer.

384
00:28:55.469 --> 00:28:57.130
There's even no need to do so.

385
00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.570
Boo Cheon is...

386
00:28:58.669 --> 00:29:01.040
so feeble-minded...

387
00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:02.340
that he's easy to deal with.

388
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.880
I need you to visit Ms. Han...

389
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.779
and see what's going on in Mooshimjae.

390
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.110
Okay.

391
00:29:09.949 --> 00:29:13.320
(Pulipchae)

392
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.890
(Pulipchae)

393
00:29:18.989 --> 00:29:20.189
So...

394
00:29:20.489 --> 00:29:23.390
Father just gave Yeo Cheon a short scolding,

395
00:29:23.459 --> 00:29:25.330
right?

396
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.499
It is.

397
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.469
I guess he was happy to see Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon...

398
00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:32.499
who had been in rivalry all the time.

399
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.570
Or...

400
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.679
Attorney Kang skillfully arbitrated between them.

401
00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:39.739
See you later.

402
00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:18.820
How is it?

403
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.249
I like it, but the chef must taste it too.

404
00:30:29.189 --> 00:30:30.459
This is good.

405
00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:34.769
It's convenient. It's easy to cook on the spot.

406
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.400
What brings you here?

407
00:30:41.209 --> 00:30:43.840
I came here to pay you my gratitude.

408
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.080
Thank you so much for bringing Yeo Cheon...

409
00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:47.850
back to Korea.

410
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.519
He's young.

411
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.679
I couldn't let him rot in a place like that.

412
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.360
Since Boo Cheon got scolded for bringing him back to Korea,

413
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.160
tell him...

414
00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:02.560
to help Boo Cheon the best he can...

415
00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:04.499
from now on.

416
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:07.830
I've been telling him so whenever I see him.

417
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.070
I told him to stay loyal to the vice chairman.

418
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:17.140
(Mooshimwon)

419
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.090
Sir.

420
00:31:29.989 --> 00:31:31.820
I will see you tomorrow then.

421
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.999
Chairman Jang...

422
00:31:40.429 --> 00:31:42.529
doesn't look well. What's going on?

423
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:43.800
Please help him get ready for bed.

424
00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:48.040
I don't think he had a wink of sleep last night.

425
00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:51.779
What are you doing out there? Come inside, and spread the bedding.

426
00:32:14.469 --> 00:32:17.229
(Secretary Ahn)

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

428
00:32:34.219 --> 00:32:35.650
Where did you go...

429
00:32:36.219 --> 00:32:37.419
with Chairman Jang?

430
00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:39.519
He went for his medical checkup.

431
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.189
I believe he already had one only recently.

432
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:47.729
Boo Cheon...

433
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.669
brought Yeo Cheon back behind your back.

434
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.239
From now on, there will be more things...

435
00:32:56.769 --> 00:32:58.540
that I won't know.

436
00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:01.610
That cannot be.

437
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.709
Boo Cheon.

438
00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:06.179
He still needs your help.

439
00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:09.320
If you give Boo Cheon free rein,

440
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.989
all three of us might face problems.

441
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.529
You must take care of Boo Cheon...

442
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.729
as you keep...

443
00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:22.429
a close watch on him for the time being.

444
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.340
Okay?

445
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.640
Pil Joo.

446
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.979
To reward you...

447
00:33:35.009 --> 00:33:36.910
helping Boo Cheon become the vice chairman,

448
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.890
I want to give you shares of Daeil Distribution. What do you think?

449
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.959
Since both of us worked for this,

450
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.660
I can give you half of my shares.

451
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:59.439
Seeing how surprised you are about my reward...

452
00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:01.209
makes me...

453
00:34:02.169 --> 00:34:03.610
very happy.

454
00:34:04.739 --> 00:34:06.140
I am the only one...

455
00:34:06.939 --> 00:34:08.610
who gave you this much money to you...

456
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.649
in your life, right?

457
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.750
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.489
Figure out a way how you're going to take them from me.

459
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:22.859
I will.

460
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.660
Tell me.

461
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.000
Is my reward...

462
00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:30.529
beyond your imagination?

463
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.940
It is truly...

465
00:34:39.779 --> 00:34:41.049
beyond my imagination.

466
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.989
Did you look into Pil Joo?

467
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:52.719
Yes.

468
00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:54.989
Secretary Oh.

469
00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.359
Do you know why...

470
00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:01.529
Pil Joo is trying to make me...

471
00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:04.170
the chairman instead of Yeo Cheon?

472
00:35:06.799 --> 00:35:08.940
It's because I'm an easier target than Yeo Cheon...

473
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.410
since I don't have a father.

474
00:35:15.049 --> 00:35:16.149
Lately,

475
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.250
I've been thinking a lot...

476
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.190
what his intention could be.

477
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.960
After he helps me become the chairman,

478
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:30.660
he will reveal himself as Jang Eun Cheon and push me out,

479
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.170
so he can become the chairman himself.

480
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.170
That's why...

481
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.339
he's keeping quiet that I'm not a Jang and waiting for his time.

482
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.750
When he pushes me out,

483
00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.310
he's going to reveal that secret.

484
00:35:56.989 --> 00:35:57.989
Secretary Oh.

485
00:35:59.489 --> 00:36:01.830
I am not going to lose out to Pil Joo.

486
00:36:02.929 --> 00:36:04.759
I'm going to protect my chairmanship.

487
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.129
Mark my words.

488

490
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.120
Pil Joo.

491
00:36:32.219 --> 00:36:35.129
In which team do you want to work when Strategy Team is disbanded?

492
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.929
I visited Dr. Hwang today...

493
00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:40.629
with your grandfather.

494
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.000
I was escorting him for the medical checkup.

495
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:50.640
You came here because you were curious.

496
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.279
You wanted to know...

497
00:36:55.009 --> 00:36:56.049
where we went.

498
00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120
You got me.

499
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:04.489
But why didn't you answer your phone?

500
00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:08.489
There are two people who make me sad when they don't answer my call.

501
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.560
They are you and Mo Hyun.

502
00:37:12.899 --> 00:37:14.500
Let me go back to my first question.

503
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.239
So in which team do you want to work?

504
00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.509
After Strategy Team is disbanded.

505
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.410
- Should I work in Cheong A Bio? - I'd love that.

506
00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:26.879
Hey,

507
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.109
how about working at the New York Bio Research Center?

508
00:37:32.379 --> 00:37:34.390
Strike while the iron is still hot.

509
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.960
Let's settle that you will go to New York next month.

510
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.290
I'll think about it.

511
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.310
Ms. Na.

512
00:38:30.469 --> 00:38:32.080
I heard what happened...

513
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:33.879
in Mooshimjae.

514
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.910
Don't do that next time.

515
00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.290
If you provoke Chairman Jang,

516
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.790
it will only make your life harder.

517
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.359
I'm going to...

518
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.160
hand in the recording to the police.

519
00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:56.600
- Are you sure? - Nothing is stopping me.

520
00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.399
Even Grandfather told me to do so.

521
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.370
It never occurred to you...

522
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.179
that it's possible for Chairman Jang...

523
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.210
to know that your father...

524
00:39:08.149 --> 00:39:09.310
is alive, correct?

525
00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:13.750
I...

526
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.420
always think of that possibility.

527
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.830
Since Congressman Na is alive,

528
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.199
you can only report it as attempted instigation...

529
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.429
to commit suicide.

530
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.699
If you do,

531
00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.969
you will be revealing to the public...

532
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.770
that Congressman Na is alive.

533
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.480
It's possible that Chairman Jang...

534
00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.250
could have taken everything into account...

535
00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.250
and told you on purpose...

536
00:39:50.819 --> 00:39:53.620
to take it to the police.

537
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:03.100
Mo Hyun.

538
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.279
I'll take you. Let's go.

539
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.520
Pil Joo,

540
00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:26.219
I got a call from the person in charge of the New York center.

541
00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.060
They want you to come earlier than planned.

542
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.160
I told them that...

543
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.859
when you go this time, you'll be able to stay there...

544
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.199
for five years, just like I did.

545
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.190
Ma'am.

546
00:40:57.819 --> 00:40:59.390
I got Attorney Kang's signature...

547
00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.290
for the contract...

548
00:41:01.989 --> 00:41:03.730
on the Daeil Distribution stock you promised him.

549
00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.969
(Daeil Distribution Stock Transfer Contract)

550
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.580
Upload the articles on Chairman Jang.

551
00:42:30.879 --> 00:42:31.980
Really?

552
00:42:32.279 --> 00:42:35.290
The appointed time was when the bank office hours started.

553
00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.460
The appointed time...

554
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.190
is over.

555
00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.589
All right.

556
00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:43.230
I'll send some to the internet newspapers.

557
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:58.640
Are you deleting all the articles that Pil Joo is uploading?

558
00:42:58.879 --> 00:42:59.879
Yes, sir.

559
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.379
The news on the portals won't even be uploaded.

560
00:43:03.879 --> 00:43:06.149
As for the rest, the online team I've recruited...

561
00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:07.549
is doing its job.

562
00:43:09.089 --> 00:43:10.920
But sir,

563
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.819
I don't understand...

564
00:43:12.859 --> 00:43:15.759
why Attorney Kang would dare do this.

565
00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:19.299
I went too easy on him. He's become bold.

566
00:43:19.929 --> 00:43:23.270
I want to make sure he learns a lesson this time.

567
00:43:31.339 --> 00:43:33.609
Pil Joo, the articles that we upload...

568
00:43:33.609 --> 00:43:35.980
don't last seconds before they're all deleted.

569
00:43:36.279 --> 00:43:38.980
Chairman Jang must have recruited an online team for this.

570
00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:40.920
We're outnumbered.

571
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.049
How about Reporter Ma from Taesan Daily...

572
00:43:43.149 --> 00:43:44.319
and the major newspaper companies?

573
00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:48.960
Don't forget Jang Yeo Cheon's father-in-law,

574
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.560
Chairman Lee of Hanmin Daily.

575
00:43:51.699 --> 00:43:54.670
He called the other owners of newspaper companies...

576
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:58.000
to get rid of any articles concerning Chairman Jang.

577
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.310
No one will dare risk their lives and write articles...

578
00:44:01.969 --> 00:44:03.810
when the company's owner is against it.

579
00:44:06.739 --> 00:44:07.850
I think...

580
00:44:08.149 --> 00:44:09.910
we failed this time.

581
00:44:30.129 --> 00:44:34.109
(Honorary Chairman Jang Kook Hwan)

582
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.440
Yes, sir.

583
00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:43.779
Are you going to cause trouble with these articles again?

584
00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.750
I have a Plan B, Chairman Jang.

585
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.489
You've already lost.

586
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.890
What is your Plan B?

587
00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:54.690
You can come back and bring it to me.

588
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.560
I will. Soon,

589
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.359
I will start working on Plan B.

590
00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:00.929
Sir,

591
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.399
I hope you don't regret this.

592
00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:07.739
Attorney Kang,

593
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.679
has Congressman Na that you took...

594
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.810
opened his eyes or something?

595
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.350
It's not like people at Taesan Hospital are all on your side.

596
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.319
Where did you move him...

597
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:23.949
from the house he was staying at?

598
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:32.129
I don't care if he opens his eyes.

599
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.600
But...

600
00:45:33.899 --> 00:45:35.929
he cannot open his mouth.

601
00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:38.699
You know that well enough.

602
00:46:00.989 --> 00:46:05.000
(Mo Hyun)

603
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:30.319
Sir.

604
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.940
I've heard from Pil Joo.

605
00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.940
I'm prepared for this.

606
00:46:54.009 --> 00:46:55.179
But...

607
00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.879
you still won't be able to cope with this.

608
00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.779
Everyone else knows.

609
00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.120
It'll be better than this situation where I'm the only one not knowing.

610
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:09.859
Attorney Kang...

611
00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:12.259
didn't tell you anything about your father?

612
00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.899
Pil Joo had to get close to Father,

613
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.069
so he planned that Boo Cheon and I would meet.

614
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.370
That's what I heard.

615
00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:26.679
Attorney Kang...

616
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.009
did get to Congressman Na.

617
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.449
But Mo Hyun,

618
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.190
before you and Boo Cheon met,

619
00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.319
your father and Executive Jung met...

620
00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.190
and discussed about...

621
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.529
how you two should meet...

622
00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.429
as if it were a coincidence.

623
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.410
Congressman Na wasn't sure about it.

624
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.810
He thought about it for days...

625
00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:05.179
and agreed to become the Chief Campaigner.

626
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.649
That was how...

627
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.690
he sent the signal to Cheong A...

628
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.620
that he was going to accept.

629
00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.520
He really...

630
00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:49.460
wanted to become a president.

631
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.399
That's all there is...

632
00:48:53.259 --> 00:48:55.629
to the truth of Congressman Na.

633
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.540
He met Cheong A Group...

634
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.509
like fate...

635
00:49:05.279 --> 00:49:07.350
in order to fulfill his dream.

636
00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:12.080
But it became difficult for his dream to become true,

637
00:49:13.149 --> 00:49:15.649
so he let go of his dream...

638
00:49:16.819 --> 00:49:18.560
and his life.

639
00:49:19.759 --> 00:49:21.560
You should break up with Boo Cheon...

640
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.500
and leave Cheong A.

641
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.199
Tell me when you've made up...

642
00:49:30.629 --> 00:49:31.839
your mind.

643
00:49:34.339 --> 00:49:35.440
I...

644
00:49:39.379 --> 00:49:41.850
will be your attorney.

645
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:44.940
Pastor.

646
00:50:46.779 --> 00:50:49.949
Chairman Jang knows that Congressman Na is...

647
00:50:50.049 --> 00:50:51.149
alive.

648
00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.420
Then...

649
00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:55.449
isn't it dangerous to have him at his home?

650
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.020
It's still safer to stay there.

651
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.129
He may get exposed the moment we try to transfer him.

652
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.799
I think I should accompany you for a while...

653
00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:07.199
when you go check Congressman Na.

654
00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.239
(Email from Jang Boo Cheon)

655
00:51:17.379 --> 00:51:20.339
(Dear Pil Joo.)

656
00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:23.310
Pil Joo. Pick the house you like...

657
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.080
when you go work in New York.

658
00:51:25.719 --> 00:51:26.750
I'll pay for it.

659
00:51:27.649 --> 00:51:29.219
It doesn't matter how expensive it is.

660
00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:39.429
Pil Joo.

661
00:51:42.129 --> 00:51:44.969
- Have you read my email? - Yes. Just now.

662
00:51:45.399 --> 00:51:48.739
A mansion's better than a house for someone who lives alone like you.

663
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.279
It's such a hassle to clean up snow with a house in winter.

664
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.310
I've thought about your date of departure.

665
00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.379
List Daeil Distribution.

666
00:51:57.449 --> 00:51:59.779
Finish donating the fund to the foundation.

667
00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:03.449
Then leave after a week of break. How's that sound?

668
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.699
(Mo Hyun)

669
00:52:11.299 --> 00:52:12.429
Hi. Mo Hyun.

670
00:52:34.049 --> 00:52:35.089
Mo Hyun.

671
00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.290
I met Aide Yang today.

672
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.460
The fact that my father was positive about our marriage.

673
00:52:46.629 --> 00:52:48.899
And the amount of money he received from Cheong A.

674
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:52.040
I found all about it.

675
00:52:56.969 --> 00:52:57.980
I...

676
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.609
was sold for money.

677
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.160
I'll never forget the truth...

678
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.129
that you really loved me.

679
00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:18.799
Mo Hyun.

680
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.230
It was hard to understand...

681
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.339
that you had no choice but to live with Yoon Seo Won in New York...

682
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.509
for Ha Jung,

683
00:53:32.179 --> 00:53:33.179
but...

684
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.279
while living with you in New York,

685
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.080
I was happy.

686
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.520
Mo Hyun. Please.

687
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.960
Let's stop struggling...

688
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.290
in the net...

689
00:53:51.859 --> 00:53:55.299
that Pil Joo, Mother, and Dad...

690
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.609
created.

691
00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.109
I'll...

692
00:54:06.339 --> 00:54:07.679
rip that net.

693
00:54:14.649 --> 00:54:15.750
Please...

694
00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.960
give me one more chance.

695
00:54:33.299 --> 00:54:35.040
(Recording files)

696
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.069
If you could...

697
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:08.140
cut the ties with this world...

698
00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.839
embracing all these matters,

699
00:55:12.379 --> 00:55:14.779
I'll take care of...

700
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.379
Mo Hyun and your grandchild...

701
00:55:18.679 --> 00:55:20.149
since I still have ties left.

702
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.859
I'm sorry, Mo Hyun.

703
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:36.730
I'm...

704
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.940
really sorry.

705
00:55:44.779 --> 00:55:46.339
No matter how much I apologize,

706
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:51.920
what my grandfather did would not disappear,

707
00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.850
but I'm really sorry.

708
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:13.299
Let's not take it to the court.

709
00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.640
Let's divorce by consent.

710
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.379
Give me half of your fortune...

711
00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:23.210
that increased after the marriage...

712
00:56:24.449 --> 00:56:25.549
as alimony.

713
00:56:28.949 --> 00:56:32.489
I told Mother to pay me for the fake marriage.

714
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.160
Mother,

715
00:56:38.929 --> 00:56:40.129
Grandfather,

716
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:46.239
and even my dad...

717
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:52.540
made us get married for money in the end.

718
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:59.080
From this,

719
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:05.420
I realized that I must have money to win those...

720
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.190
who try to control other people's lives with money.

721
00:57:14.469 --> 00:57:16.429
Let's tell Mother tomorrow.

722
00:57:18.199 --> 00:57:20.270
I'll move out after telling Mother.

723
00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:21.739
Mo Hyun.

724
00:57:25.839 --> 00:57:27.210
Since you want it,

725
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.649
I'll think about the divorce.

726
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.020
But...

727
00:57:36.989 --> 00:57:38.290
if...

728
00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:43.790
I can never break up with you,

729
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.670
then...

730
00:57:53.899 --> 00:57:55.239
please turn back to me.

731
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.410
Please.

732
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.279
Mo Hyun.

733
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:23.069
Congratulations...

734
00:58:23.429 --> 00:58:25.170
on Boo Cheon becoming the vice chairman.

735
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.770
- Thank you. - Mal Ran.

736
00:58:29.009 --> 00:58:30.040
You should...

737
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:34.049
chuck out Pil Joo now.

738
00:58:37.679 --> 00:58:39.149
It's about time now.

739
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:42.549
He did most of the work...

740
00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:45.060
to get here.

741
00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:46.859
He'll...

742
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.489
continue to work for Boo Cheon.

743
00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:52.929
It wasn't easy to bring it up because I'm well aware...

744
00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:55.299
how much you like him.

745
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:58.500
Boo Cheon is my nephew.

746
00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:01.540
I thought I should tell you this...

747
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.140
even if you kick me out...

748
00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.810
for my late brother's sake.

749
00:59:10.149 --> 00:59:12.779
It's always the best to prevent anything before happening.

750
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:16.020
What are you worried about?

751
00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.160
There are me, Yeo Cheon...

752
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:19.620
and you.

753
00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.699
You must get rid of a ladder called Kang Pil Joo...

754
00:59:27.899 --> 00:59:30.699
to make Boo Cheon shine more at the top.

755
01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.750
Ms. Na.

756
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.690
I said...

757
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.290
that I came back to Mooshimwon to find out the truth...

758
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.460
that I didn't know about my dad.

759
01:00:33.199 --> 01:00:35.929
I met Aide Yang today...

760
01:00:37.899 --> 01:00:39.500
and heard everything.

761
01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.719
So I'm leaving Mooshimwon.

762
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.960
You said you'll be my divorce lawyer.

763
01:01:02.429 --> 01:01:05.000
If I can't divorce Boo Cheon by consent,

764
01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.170
please proceed with a lawsuit.

765
01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:16.640
I know...

766
01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:22.679
you took advantage of me to get revenge for your brother...

767
01:01:24.179 --> 01:01:25.649
whom you lost...

768
01:01:28.089 --> 01:01:29.120
in the water.

769
01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:35.290
I might not be able to forgive you...

770
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.759
even after many years.

771
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:44.739
No matter how hard you try to deny,

772
01:01:47.609 --> 01:01:49.410
I know how much...

773
01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:53.580
you love me.

774
01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.420
So I want to say,

775
01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.029
"Pil Joo,"

776
01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:15.830
"forget everything here..."

777
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:22.170
"and just leave with me."

778
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.810
However,

779
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.379
I cannot fully understand...

780
01:02:33.279 --> 01:02:35.350
the dire time...

781
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:38.719
and pain...

782
01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:41.629
the boy...

783
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.270
who walked into the water had,

784
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.410
so I couldn't dare to tell you...

785
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:59.839
to give up on your revenge...

786
01:03:02.509 --> 01:03:04.420
and leave with me.

787
01:03:10.989 --> 01:03:12.620
So I'm leaving you...

788
01:03:16.629 --> 01:03:18.500
behind at Mooshimwon.

789
01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:33.160
