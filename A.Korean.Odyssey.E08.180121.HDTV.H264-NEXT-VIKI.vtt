<i>[Episode 8]</i>

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.330
<i>Wow, is that for real?</i>

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.650
<i>Cool! That's amazing!</i>

5
00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:20.874
<i>Wow, it's really cool.</i>

6
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.700
<i>Hyung, can you let me try it once?</i>

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.940
<i>Just once. Please let me try it once.</i>

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.560
<i>Hyung, if it falls, it's not good, right?</i>

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.750
<i>It's dangerous. What are you going to do?</i>

10
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.230
<i>The lady that lives in that house is scary.</i>

11
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.930
<i>Hey, you...</i>

12
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.210
<i>I don't really remember what happened that day,</i>

13
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.150
<i>but I vividly recollect the face of Seon Mi, who helped me that day.</i>

14
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.760
Ah, I was a coward when I was young.

15
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.770
But Seon Mi was very brave.

16
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.350
You were the brave one, Oppa.

17
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.690
You were nice to me when no one would talk to me.

18
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.590
This is such a beautiful connection.

19
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.700
I feel so proud of myself for setting up this opportunity.

20
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.010
In a nice atmosphere such as this, what do you think about having wine?

21
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.450
I'm in. That sounds good.

22
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.310
Secretary Ma.

23
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.070
Wine will be difficult.

24
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.810
- Why?
- The Great Sage has broken all the wine glasses.

25
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.010
This delinquent...

26
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.060
Ah, please wait just a moment.

27
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.130
He broke just the wine glasses, right?

28
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.830
He broke every single glass there is.

29
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.060
Thug.

30
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.540
<i>You better not have a good time.</i>

31
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.910
<i>Have a boring time, then leave quietly and quickly.</i>

32
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.880
Jerk.

33
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.220
Seon Mi, I'm amazed to meet you again.

34
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.600
This moment, right now.

35
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.440
It's like a movie.

36
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.050
You used to like movies, right? You used to talk a lot about movies to me.

37
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:28.590
The movie I'm making this time... it's about you.

38
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.400
- It's your story.
- My story?

39
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.570
Yeah.

40
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.650
It's like a fairy tale about a brave country girl who has mysterious abilities.

41
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.280
If it's my story, then it's closer to horror than a fairy tale.

42
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.050
No, no, no, no, no, no. In my memories, it's a fairy tale.

43
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.560
You always believed in and waited for the Fairy.

44
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.820
When you were scared and in difficult times, you said the Fairy would appear and save you.

45
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.030
I did. The Fairy.

46
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.670
Did that Fairy appear?

47
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.410
He did appear.

48
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.350
But my Fairy does not belong in a beautiful fairy tale.

49
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.630
Sam Jang is meeting with another man.

50
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.000
Secretary Ma says that the Great Sage is dangerous, so he needs to be watched carefully.

51
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.280
Why is he smiling? It's scary.

52
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.320
Go ask him.

53
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.560
Romantic relationships are your area of expertise, Jeo Pal Gye.

54
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.410
If I went next to him in this atmosphere I will become boiled slices of pork in shabu shabu.

55
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.480
If he is giving off sparks, it should at least be sweet sour pork.

56
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.680
Ah, it seems an analysis of the Great Sage's emotions is very difficult to do.

57
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.450
Right now that person is deep in a one-dimensional happiness.

58
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.940
A one-dimensional happiness? Because of what?

59
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.850
Ah.

60
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.780
Isn't that what Secretary Ma said?

61
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.250
They kissed and had a big fight before leaving.

62
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.360
So you're saying he's like that right now because he's happy about the kiss?

63
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.240
Wow, that monkey was an idiot?

64
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.150
I suddenly feel embarrassed that we were worried.

65
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.280
Wow.

66
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.890
Hyungnim, aren't you worried?

67
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.040
Sam Jang is meeting another man.

68
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.930
Sheesh, I don't need to worry. Sam Jang would never betray me.

69
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.940
If she betrays me, we made a promise that I could stab her to death with a knife.

70
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.950
As long as I don't see it with my own two eyes and feel bad, it's fine.

71
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.170
People's hearts are not that simple.

72
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.940
I mean, the Oppa that was Sam Jang's first love has appeared. How do you think she feels?

73
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.770
How would I know that? Those are her feelings.

74
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.650
You should look closely.

75
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.670
I heard that man is a good guy.

76
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.340
What if she falls for him while she's with him?

77
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.310
Anyway, she can't make it obvious if she doesn't want to die.

78
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.760
Yes, yes.

79
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.200
If she doesn't want to die at the hands of the Great Sage, she'll have to hold back no matter how much she likes that Oppa.

80
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.180
As long as she doesn't show it, right? I get it. I do.

81
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.520
Oh my, it's fire.

82
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.610
Don't you see he's boiling now? Get out quickly before you become sweet sour pork.

83
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.050
Okay.

84
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.010
Her feeling good makes me feel terrible.

85
00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.220
This time together was very worthwhile.

86
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.940
Please take Jin Seon Mi back to her place.

87
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.600
Of course.

88
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.440
Seon Mi, shall we?

89
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.150
You go ahead.

90
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.250
I have someone to meet here.

91
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.100
Who is it?

92
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.950
The Fairy.

93
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.510
My Fairy has a nasty temper, so I think I need to see him and placate him.

94
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.640
Please get home safely.

95
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.250
Alright.

96
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.100
See you later.

97
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.840
Ah, yes.

98
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.600
Thank you for having me.

99
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.700
Thank you for inviting me today.

100
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.270
Thanks to you, I found a precious connection from my childhood.

101
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.290
I will be rooting for that connection to continue.

102
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:09.090
I'm asking since you said that you will be rooting for us, but by chance, do you know Seon Mi's Fairy?

103
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.780
The Fairy, you say? I'm not sure.

104
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.150
Seon Mi was always waiting for the Fairy.

105
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.180
I thought it was just an imaginary being.

106
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.080
But it must have been a real person.

107
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.740
Well, we'll say that he's a fairy, so that you aren't taken aback,

108
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:38.180
But the thing is, the Fairy's work is to help her meet the Prince.

109
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.750
Look correctly at fairy tales.

110
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:45.710
The Fairy gets lost when she meets the Prince.

111
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.140
Right. I should look correctly at the fairy tale again.

112
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.810
- Thank you.
- It was fun.

113
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.520
Good bye.

114
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.910
Did you have fun today?

115
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.950
Yes, well.

116
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.120
The two of you suit each other well. I hope it works out well.

117
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.590
No way... Are you being caring towards me, Secretary Ma?

118
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.070
No way. Because it's what Ma Wang wants.

119
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.380
I have no thoughts on it whatsoever.

120
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.200
But I didn't know that Ma Wang would really introduce me to a human man.

121
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.910
The meeting was set up with great care. You should have left with him and enjoyed your time together some more.

122
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.850
If I enjoy myself, I think he will act up more.

123
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.070
The Great Sage ruined everything.

124
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.160
Where did he go after ruining a good moment for others?

125
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.150
<i>I missed you.</i>

126
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.370
<i>I'm not taking Son Oh Gong with me.</i>

127
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.450
<i>Last time when we went into the portrait,</i>

128
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.670
<i>you locked up our Oh Gong in there.</i>

129
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.580
<i>There is no time. We must hurry.</i>

130
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:48.120
<i>You must be in a hurry because of the movie you're supposed to watch out there.</i>

131
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.040
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

132
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.220
<i>Because you wished to get rid of me?</i>

133
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:59.040
<i>My fairy has a nasty temper, so I think I need to see him and placate him.</i>

134
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.900
She's going to be fooled again by the fairy. That...

135
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.130
I'll have to show her those...

136
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.450
You are finished now.

137
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.220
There's no forgiving, or mercy either.

138
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.530
You were left here to watch over Sam Jang.

139
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.270
Yet you didn't even know a man like that was sticking around right next to her?

140
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.960
You failed in your duty!

141
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.940
Now you are going to turn into dust and disappear.

142
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.940
What are you doing here?

143
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.160
Doing what? I was just sitting here.

144
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.030
It seemed like you were talking to someone.

145
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.220
No one's here.

146
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.630
Why is he over there?

147
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:07.900
Oh. I was going to throw him away because he's useless.

148
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.830
Why would you throw my things away as you please?

149
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.390
Oh, it hurts.

150
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.930
You don't look like you're in a good mood. I guess you didn't have a good time.

151
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.330
It was a meaningful time. I gained a great deal of enlightenment.

152
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.530
Yes, well, you shouldn't meet another human after placing the Geumganggo on me.

153
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.620
I'm glad you realized. You need to have a conscience.

154
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:48.600
Oh, so you, Mr. Fairy, prepared such delicious seasonings because of your tremendous conscience?

155
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.480
- Seasoning?
- I saw it your house. Mr. Fairy's secret seasonings.

156
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.140
<i>They are seasonings carefully made by Son Oh Gong</i>

157
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.430
<i>and boiled for three nights and four days.</i>

158
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.470
These seasoning, really...

159
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.810
You don't mean...

160
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.890
Like this.

161
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.550
Like this.

162
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.350
He intended to season you up and eat you just like that.

163
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.260
Correct. I made those seasonings.

164
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.580
But why are you criticizing them?

165
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.860
Because you intended to use it when you eat me up.

166
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.090
Why are you so selfish? Why do you only think about yourself?

167
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.230
I put so much effort into making the seasoning but yet, I didn't eat you up.

168
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.400
Then you should be thankful to me! Why are you getting so angry?

169
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.290
For a second, I almost said sorry and thank you.

170
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.390
Nevermind. I'm not in love you with you in order to hear official declarations.

171
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.460
I'll let it pass.

172
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.050
Pass? Pass on what?

173
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.610
All right. At this point I'm not going quibble over why you made it.

174
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.170
- But then why didn't you throw it away?
- Why would I? You can't be wasteful if you want to live well.

175
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:31.700
You're saving it to use later? You're going to eat me up when the Geumganggo is removed?

176
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.890
Stop saying those kinds of things. Do you know how sad it makes to think about stuff like that?

177
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.700
Didn't Ma Wang also tell you that I was crying while holding the seasonings?!

178
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.310
He didn't, huh? Always leaving out the important parts, that darned bull.

179
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.950
Why are you blaming Ma Wang here?

180
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.250
I understand. I'll forgive both you and Ma Wang.

181
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.710
Never mind. Let's not talk about it anymore! It's Done. Over.

182
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.070
Fine. You didn't have a good time because you spent it thinking about me, right?

183
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.470
Then, from now on I will make it fun for you.

184
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.600
I didn't think about you.

185
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.100
I had a fun time.

186
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.390
If I just hadn't found out about that seasoning, it would have been a great time.

187
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:17.100
Don't lie. You were bothered while thinking about it.

188
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.700
Huh? About what?

189
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.920
Oh, that? I wasn't bothered by it at all.

190
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.790
- You weren't?
- No.

191
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.010
At all?

192
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.680
None at all!

193
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.470
What I'm bothered about is that seasoning.

194
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.960
So, what are you going to do? Tell me clearly.

195
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.710
What do you mean? I'll be keeping them safe.

196
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.740
What? You should throw it out!

197
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.450
I don't want to. Why should I?

198
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.100
How much will you give me?

199
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.530
Even if you give me 500 won, I won't throw it away.

200
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.880
Are you really not going to throw it out?

201
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.180
Yeah. I'm a demon and once you take off the Geumganggo you're my prey.

202
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.220
In the sense that I can't forget my true identity, I have no intention of throwing it away.

203
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:13.840
I see. I thought that maybe... when the Geumganggo is removed

204
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.300
you wouldn't harm me. But, I guess that wasn't the case.

205
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.400
Alright. Keep your seasonings well.

206
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.980
And let's not forget each other's true identity.

207
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.730
Aw, It looks like those two fought.

208
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.930
Today I'm going to sleep soundly.

209
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.800
While I'm having to work like a dog till this late...

210
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.770
some lucky people are hanging out by the seaside.

211
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.340
Ah, so unfair...

212
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.340
This punk is the same age as me, but he's the owner
and chef?

213
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.930
That's so annoying.

214
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.870
Ah, so sick of it.

215
00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:00.870
Say it. You want him to fail. So say it.

216
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.850
What annoying jerk.

217
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.790
- I hope your business fails.
- Curse him out. Doesn't it feel good?

218
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.170
Curse him out! Curse him out!

219
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.130
Tell him to fail and curse him out!

220
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.590
This is the worst place!
<i>I found a cockroach while eating...</i>

221
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.680
<i>This place is like trash. It needs to be shut down.</i>

222
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.980
This place needs to fail.

223
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.080
<i>Welcome</i>

224
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.090
This place was doing amazing,

225
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.010
but after it got bad comments online, it's shutting down.

226
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.330
Because of that, can a place that was doing fine shut down?

227
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.450
Of course. These days, you do something wrong once, it's scary.

228
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.410
Tweet, tweet, inven. (controversial news)

229
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.740
You don't know what those means, right? I'll call up the owner.

230
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.150
Hello. This is Hanbit Real Estate.

231
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:11.450
I'm actually in front of the store with the CEO.

232
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.730
Or I thought I came with her, but it seems I came alone.

233
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.470
Yes, yes. Okay.

234
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.900
That shop got had by the Dokchi. (demon with poisonous talk)

235
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.910
It's a demon that has a foul mouth.

236
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:35.580
If you come across those, you either fail as you're cursed or die. You lose everything.

237
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.030
Is it like a seer?

238
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.010
It's different from that.

239
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:45.850
Predicting something will happen and making something happen only because you've curse them are two different things.

240
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:52.720
Then... did your store fail, too, because of a Dokchi?

241
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.000
My grandma is a artifact merchant.

242
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.350
I brought a few things from the shop to make some pocket change.

243
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.470
I see. So you're playing hooky, huh?

244
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.900
Don't tell anyone that you saw me, okay?

245
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.110
If there's any of these you want, I'll give it to you.

246
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.100
Why doesn't this red bell make any sound?

247
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.100
They call this the Aeryeong.

248
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.180
It's a bell that allows you to meet your match made in heaven.

249
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.650
- Really?
- It's real!

250
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.380
It's used by the Birth Grandmother (god governing childbirth).

251
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.430
But, this black bell looks prettier.

252
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.560
Ah! Don't touch the black one!

253
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.380
How did the black one get in there?

254
00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.480
Never mind these. Tell me in detail about that Dokchi.

255
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.530
<i>[Lucifer Entertainment]</i>

256
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.750
I heard that a family was broken up and shops failed because of an evil spirit called Dokchi.

257
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.420
And it's even caused suicides.

258
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.080
Whatever has been affected by the Dokchi will be ruined,

259
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:19.320
but the humans who curse others while being controlled by Dokchi, their lives are also ruined.

260
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.080
You've found us an enormous entity to deal with.

261
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.850
I think it spreads through social media.

262
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.940
I don't know where to look for this evil spirit.

263
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.590
If you want to catch a tiger, you have to enter its den.

264
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.230
Let's go with our social media plan.

265
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.550
I'll make an account with Sam Jang's real name.

266
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.770
I usually call the evil spirits out by using the lotus scent I give off.

267
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.230
But how do I call out the evil spirit through social media?

268
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.320
Follow follow me.

269
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.490
First off, let's take some picture that we can upload.

270
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.920
- Look at the two camera lenses.
- Okay.

271
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.620
I'm going to take the picture.

272
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.050
Wait, wait. Are you taking a photo for a driver's license?

273
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:15.550
The most important point of this picture is being able to see the fancy sofa. Hold one of these handbags.

274
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:23.880
A fancy bag. Also, your eyes to give off an air of carelessness to cause annoyance to others.

275
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.560
Don't look directly at the camera. Take another picture.

276
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.400
- There.
- Wow, it really does look like I'm rich.

277
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:47.980
The keys to being able to get both attention and attacks at the same time on an SNS uploaded picture are having the air of a rich person and showing off.

278
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.790
Secretary Ma, using only influential limited edition items,

279
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.350
prepare clothes, watches, shoes, and handbags.

280
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.630
Now then, I'll take the pictures. Just a moment...

281
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.970
Don't look so neat and nice. Like I told you earlier,

282
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:17.310
a looking down your nose and arrogantly rude gaze.

283
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.870
Your legs, your legs

284
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.090
Your legs are too awkward. Try crossing your legs.

285
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.480
Cross them like this, your legs.

286
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.140
Don't lay back.

287
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.930
Yes. Straighten out your back.

288
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.750
Stand up for a bit. Sitting isn't the right way to go.

289
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.260
Don't stand like a man.

290
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.280
Put your right foot a little forward and a little...

291
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.150
No, don't pose with your hands.

292
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.940
You look extremely unnatural right now.

293
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.020
Try looking. There. I'm taking it now.

294
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:53.590
Have all of Lucifer Entertainment's stars follow Sam Jang's account.

295
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.990
<i>Great. 1719. #Today Also #Living the High Life.</i>

296
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.210
Who is she? Who does she think she is?

297
00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.740
I know, right? She's not even pretty.

298
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.910
She's just showing off. Saying "I'm wearing something like this."

299
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.680
Yeah, she's wearing all the brand name stuff.

300
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.810
<i>What the heck...</i>

301
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.410
Hey, what's that?

302
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.720
Isn't that PK?

303
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.890
Scroll down, scroll down.

304
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.280
CEO... is this really you?

305
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.690
Yes. I had them taken earlier today.

306
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.010
You took them earlier today

307
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.750
but there's already 115,000 followers?!

308
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.830
CEO, I won't beat around the bush.

309
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.960
I'm always "Salute, salute" for you. You know that, right?

310
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.180
A lot of people whom I don't even know are talking about me.

311
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.440
It makes me feel weird.

312
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.820
Because these pictures are very show-offy

313
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.950
there's a lot of criticism, but don't get bothered.

314
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:46.940
It's because they're envious.

315
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.430
I don't mind. I did it to get cursed at.

316
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.040
What?

317
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.970
I need to get more harsh critiques though...

318
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.930
What do I need to do to get cursed out more?

319
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.030
Hmm, well, since I'm always "Salute, Salute" for you,

320
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.840
let's try thinking about it.

321
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.660
Normally... people who act too cutesy for their age get totally cursed at.

322
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.280
- Cutesy?
- Tee-hee. Things like that.

323
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.130
Tee-hee.

324
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.950
<i>Great. 9,969. #Today Also #Living the High Life #Cosmic Power</i>

325
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.520
Why is Sam Jang acting like this?

326
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.460
She's in the midst of catching a Dokchwi evil spirit.

327
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.850
Isn't Son Oh Gong going to catch the evil spirit with her?

328
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:34.480
Sam Jang discovered the seasonings he made to cover and eat her up with.

329
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.500
Oh, goodness. Sam Jang must be very upset.

330
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.810
What's there to be upset about?

331
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.590
Oh Gong is a demon after all.

332
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.210
By the way, this is too cold.

333
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.940
Take it easy a little. Your strength is too great these days.

334
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.810
It's currently the time period where my strength is the greatest.

335
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.940
So that's why you could freeze Geumganggo, no?

336
00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.540
Y-You knew about that?

337
00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.930
Since Sam Jang wanted to know how Great Sage truly felt,

338
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.900
I put in a little strength for just a bit.

339
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.240
I can't do it again.

340
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.500
You did something futile. Until Sam Jang's summons has been fulfilled,

341
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.290
feelings can't ever be allowed to get in the way.

342
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.740
So in order for the two of them to never know how the other truly feels,

343
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.710
you had Geumganggo put on him?

344
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.050
Oh, so cold!

345
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.210
It's so cold my ears have frozen solid.

346
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.870
I'm leaving.

347
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.860
Left is PK and to the right, Alice.

348
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.630
There. With just this one picture, your followers will increase like crazy.

349
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.410
It might even get an article written about it.

350
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.880
Now then, one more...

351
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.290
Hey! I told you not to do that.

352
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:01.710
It's because having two things sticking out of my front is unnatural.

353
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.240
Once you get used to them, does it become easy go around with?

354
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.370
What? Well...

355
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.930
You're called Sam Jang?

356
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.620
I'm the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Jade Dragon.

357
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.070
I heard. You're a prince.

358
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.450
When things work out well for me, I'll give you a tour of the sea palace.

359
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.710
Hey, Octopus, how can you think about flirting while using that body?

360
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.460
What are you saying? This is instinct.

361
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.490
I've got octopus legs. (sticky)

362
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.650
If you stretch that leg out to Sam Jang and not watch yourself,

363
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.640
Gret Sage will make you into takoyaki. (battered and cooked octopus)

364
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.990
Takoyaki?

365
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.170
It makes me feel really pitiful.

366
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.690
Are you Son Oh Gong's woman?

367
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:55.520
No, I'm not. That kind of expression makes me feel offended.

368
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.790
I know how to make Takoyaki as well.

369
00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.570
So please watch yourself.

370
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.150
Thank you for taking the pictures.

371
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:15.590
Like I thought, Sam Jang doesn't have one bit of feelings for Son Oh Gong.

372
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.010
What to do? That poor Great Sage is so pitiful.

373
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.720
By the way, Pig, this woman can't drink alcohol?

374
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.270
Yeah. Alice can't drink...

375
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.900
Hey! When did you drink all that!

376
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.170
I'm going to the Dragon Palace.

377
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.520
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Octopus! Octopus!!

378
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.540
Hey, Alice! Wake up!

379
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.970
What are you talking about going to the Dragon Palace now?

380
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.920
This is driving me crazy, seriously.

381
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.050
<i>Great. 7,718. #Today Also#Living the High Life.</i>

382
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.700
The automatic data reader is very scary.

383
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.510
Not long ago, it attached itself to one of our company's employees,

384
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:53.580
and that employee ran himself off the roof.

385
00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.890
Son Oh Gong, isn't Unni in danger?

386
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.120
Don't you need to go to her?

387
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.150
I will. After I see the spectacle I've been waiting to see.

388
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.620
He should be here by now. Why isn't he here yet?

389
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.220
He's seen it. He saw it.

390
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.190
That crazy psycho bastard!

391
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.880
What is this? What exactly is this look?

392
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.960
He doesn't even have nipples. How dare he turns him into a milking cow?

393
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.920
Ah... Except for his horns, he messed it all up! That thug!

394
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.710
Ma Wang!

395
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.670
Oh dear, you've become a milk cow. Were you originally a milk cow?

396
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.070
You dared to turn my bull into a milk cow!

397
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:49.850
Let's just end things here today.

398
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:53.480
I'm going to blow up that monkey punk right now. Watch closely!

399
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.460
Save your strength! I didn't even do it.

400
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.970
Are you kidding me you little...

401
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.020
The culprit is someone else.

402
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.070
- Ma Wang, I did it.
- What?

403
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.270
I'm an immature person and I scribbled on it.

404
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.140
See? The zombie said she did it.

405
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.770
Don't kid me. Anyone can tell you must have ordered her to do it.

406
00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:15.820
There's a witness.

407
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.910
I saw Bu Ja do it.

408
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.660
You people are really...

409
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.270
The zombie said she did it.

410
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.580
If you're going to get angry, get angry at her.

411
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.100
Oh Jeong, you... Geez, that's really an ugly sight.

412
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.690
Clean that up for him.

413
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.590
Dear, dear. So Ma Wang was a milk cow after all.

414
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.820
Ma Wang Milk Cow Style! Ma Wang Milk Cow Style!

415
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.180
- Hey, Son Oh Gong! Son Oh Gong!
- Ma Wang Milk Cow Style!

416
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.390
What? What? What? What?

417
00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:44.740
What is the reason for this unfunny prank?

418
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.530
I'm ending it with a mischievous prank. A mischievous prank.

419
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:53.650
I can't really fight to the death with you here.

420
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.700
Let's just laugh at the prank and move on, okay? This time...

421
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.180
I lost.
<i>(Sounds like milk cow)</i>

422
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:18.110
Crazy bastard... I guess he was really angry this time.

423
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:24.930
Ma Wang, I think the milk cow is cuter.

424
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:32.700
Bu Ja, if you think it's cute, should I paint you like that too?

425
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.560
I don't want that.

426
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:44.200
Ma Wang, if the milk cow is unsightly to you,

427
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.480
should I paint it completely black?

428
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.960
Don't do that. Is it a devil?

429
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.390
Yes, I understand.

430
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.230
I won't do that.

431
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.900
Ugh, look at you...

432
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.930
Don't worry. I'll clean and paint you up very nicely.

433
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.640
If he was going to paint on this, he should've done it right. Why give him a dark circle...

434
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.750
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll paint you whiter than you were before.

435
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.370
That crazy...

436
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.540
Gosh, seriously...

437
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.890
Bu Ja! Where are you?

438
00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.430
<i>I'm almost at the entrance of the agency. Where are you?</i>

439
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.440
I'm at the agency's parking lot. The parking lot.

440
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.540
Yeah, Moon Uh is drunk right now. So, she's coming onto me.

441
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.070
Pig, how about we heat things up tonight?

442
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.990
This is too much for me to handle!

443
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.160
I can't call up a human. You, hurry up and come. Take her away.

444
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.130
Okay. I'll come right away.

445
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.490
Hey, stop it!

446
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.410
You like it. I know!

447
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.440
- Come over here!
- Hey...

448
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.610
Let's not do this.

449
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.350
Hey, if you and I get involved, we become Ohsambul.

450
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.720
I don't want to become Ohsambul!

451
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:19.550
He took a picture of us. We're ruined!

452
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.690
Where are you going?

453
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:38.220
I heard they took the video clip here at the agency.

454
00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.510
That girl... Is she's still alive, I'm sure she's here.

455
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.980
I know I made sure she was dead.

456
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.010
She was a corpse with her arms and legs all broken.

457
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.980
There she is.

458
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.620
She's really alive. What do we do now?

459
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.930
First, let's catch her.

460
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.970
What are we doing to do then?

461
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:09.840
If she recognizes us, we should kill her.

462
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.030
Bu Ja! Did you see a reporter?

463
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.530
- No, I didn't.
- That's bad!

464
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.370
I think they're going to write up an article on me. It's all because of that Moon Uh!

465
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.950
Ah! It's too shameful to have a scandal with Moon Uh.

466
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.750
I feel so uneasy.

467
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.310
Where is the Prince?

468
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.040
Over there in the parking lot.

469
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.820
Oh, yeah. Let's go and take care of him first. Let's go.

470
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.620
A girl who was thought to be dead is still alive. And she's hanging around a top star.

471
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.260
What is that girl's identity exactly?

472
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.990
Why isn't that girl coming to see her mother if she's still alive?

473
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:16.150
Hyungnim, shouldn't we tell her that the girl didn't die and is still alive?

474
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.680
Let's look into it a little more.

475
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.790
It's possible that kid lost her memory.

476
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.210
<i>[Looking for a person]
[Name: Jeong Se Ra, age: 20, last seen: Gyeonggido, Bundang]</i>

477
00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:30.690
If that's the case, then we can settle this nice and quietly.

478
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.200
Sam Jang has reached over 130,000 followers.

479
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.350
And she's been searching for those who consistently leave malicious comments.

480
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.300
Persons having an automatic data reader attached to them are bound to come out among them. What about Son Oh Gong?

481
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.400
Apparently, the two of them have yet to make up.

482
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.520
It seems you've successfully pitted them against each other. Congratulations.

483
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:02.600
Son Oh Gong already threw out all the seasoning containers.

484
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:08.180
If Sam Jang knew that then they'd be able to make up.

485
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.540
Shall I make fake seasoning containers in order to prolong the misunderstanding for as long as possible?

486
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.250
That's a wonderfully underhanded and good idea. For now, go ahead and do so.

487
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.750
Understood.

488
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:23.310
I will work towards making sure she continues to fear being eaten after Geumganggo is gone.

489
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:30.500
But, Secretary Ma, is that really what Sam Jang is scared of?

490
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.040
Pardon?

491
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.750
Would she be scared of being eaten up at this point?

492
00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.920
He's too much.

493
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.750
If I were to take off Geumganggo now,

494
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.260
I would be...

495
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:59.010
I would be...

496
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.130
It didn't look like she was crying because she was scared.

497
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.190
What else could be scary other than being eaten?

498
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.930
The human heart is more complicated and difficult.

499
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:23.750
That has to be figured out in order for Sam Jang to lose her anger.

500
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:31.220
I have to figure it out first so I can make sure Son Oh Gong can never relieve her anger.

501
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:43.970
I was told they should be here around this time.

502
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.580
The person writing the most malicious comments,

503
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.720
is this person.

504
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.060
She often posts pictures from inside M-Mart in the morning. Try going there.

Oh! Woah! Hey!

507
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.090
Hi.

508
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.770
Are you all right?

509
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.430
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.

510
00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:37.630
By the way, why are you here?

511
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.770
I called the real estate office and Han Joo told me you would be here.

512
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.470
Han Joo? You mean Lee Han Joo?

513
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.000
Han Joo. My friend?

514
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.920
Surprise!

515
00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.970
Just a minute.

516
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:12.380
Excuse me, you took a picture of my friend just earlier, didn't you?

517
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:19.120
You're the one leaving comments on my SNS account, aren't you?

518
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.480
<i>Great. 19 today going to M Mart.</i>

519
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:34.310
I do this with my baby. It's going to the market.

520
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:39.050
So seeing you in those photos made me angry.

521
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:43.950
I started cursing you without much thought like other people do,

522
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.250
but then my comments started getting more and more harsh.

523
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.940
- I'm sorry.
- It's an evil spirit attached to you.

524
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.180
Please don't get swayed.

525
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.750
Not when you have such a pretty child like, too.

526
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.510
I'm embarassed.

527
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.590
Whenever I thought of your younger self, it was always like a fairy tale.

528
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.560
But today, even though I'm looking at you all grown up,

529
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.690
it still feels like I'm looking at the main character in a fairy tale.

530
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:33.530
Why? Because I carry around this umbrella and talk about strange things like evil spirits?

531
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.220
It's not strange. It suits you really really well.

532
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:42.850
You don't travel around with your Mr. Fairy? Is he busy?

533
00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:48.920
No, my Mr. Fairy is bad. He might even eat me, you know.

534
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.800
That's disgusting.

535
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.910
That's not a fairy; it's a monster.

536
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:59.270
You're right. He's a monster. A jerk.

537
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.790
Hey.

538
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.140
If you're going to fight with a monster

539
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.040
then you're going to need energy.

540
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.480
Stay strong.

541
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.460
Well, thank you for helping me pick out tomorrow night's dinner.

542
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.640
Not at all.

543
00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.380

544
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.820
Stop it.

545
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.050
- I threw out the seasonings.
- Okay.

546
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.330
I threw out the seasonings and have no plans to make them again.

547
00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.070
Why did you throw them out? Make them again.

548
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.920
I don't want to. I'm not going to.

549
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.890
Do whatever you want.

550
00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.530
Don't go. Come with me.

551
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.240
I don't want to. Why should I?

552
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.770
How much will you give me?

553
00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.310
Even if you give me ₩500, I'm not going with you.

554
00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.180
Why? What's wrong? Eat me up!

555
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.960

567

Don't worry. I'll clean it all off.

568
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.160
You're back early, Ma Wang.

569
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.720
I came home early to wash my bull you insulted.

570
00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:06.260
You better pray this comes off or you're dead.

571
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:16.720
- What are all these?
- Cleaning products. I bought all sorts but don't know which ones would work best.

572
00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.380
These are all cleaning products?

573
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.970
There's cleaners and there's even polish.

574
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.880
According to the mart employee, if you clean well with a dry cloth, it even make it waterproof.

575
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.180
It's not even going to get blood splattered on. Waterproof? What nonsense.

576
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.650
This is...

577
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.680
- I see it's a buy one get one free.
- Yeah.

578
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.800
Did you go to the supermarket to get cleaning products for my bull?

579
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.390
I got them while I was following Sam Jang.

580
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:07.440
Sam Jang? Ah, to catch the Dokchwi? Did she meet it?

581
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.670
She didn't meet the Dokchwi; she met a man.

582
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.170
Oh? Jonathan?

583
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:19.980
The two of them must have been going on a shopping date at the supermarket.

584
00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.500
- You watched all that?
- Yeah.

585
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:29.220
Goodness, why would you follow them all the way there just to watch something unpleasant?

586
00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.450
Sam Jang's really too much.

587
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.880
She was bad mouthing me behind my back with that guy!

588
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.490
And so?

589
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:42.090
So I struck fear into her of course! I told her I'd eat her up.

590
00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.590
Should I have not said that?

591
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:54.110
Really now, I told her I threw away all the seasonings so why is she still angry?

592
00:47:55.550 --> 00:48:02.300
Son Oh Gong, have you ever worried about what will happen after Geumganggo is gone?

593
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.320
Why would I worry about it? Everything will be great once it's gone.

594
00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:13.210
My my, everything will be good for you, won't it?

595
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.380
Then something must not be good about it for her, no?

596
00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:32.290
Could it be that she's worried that I really will eat her once Geumganggo is gone?

597
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.720
He doesn't like me one bit.

598
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.130
He likes me a little.

599
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.690
He doesn't like me.

600
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.070
If Geumganggo was gone,

601
00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.650
he'd like me.

602
00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.140
He wouldn't like me.

603
00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.180
He'd like me.

604
00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:15.630
He wouldn't like me.

605
00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.820
Hey, hey, hey! Are you just going to be on that cell phone all day long?

606
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.060
Wow, seriously...

607
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.770
Good grief, everything she's got on is brand named.

608
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.090
And she's friends with celebrities? Geez.

609
00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:53.850
Wow, a guy that's got not a damn thing got married and even has two kids?

615
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:25.000
Yeah. I bought a bunch of snacks. What ice cream?

616
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.240
Han Byeol wants to eat it?

617
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:33.140
Aw, you. You're the one who wants to eat it.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.890
Did I get another comment?

621
00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.940
At this rate, she's going to become an SNS star thanks to our CEO.

622
00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.780
Let's take a look.

623
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.240
<i>[The most deadbeat dad I've ever seen.]</i>

624
00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.890
"Deadbeat dad"?

625
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.460
Why are they calling me a deadbeat dad?

626
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:35.330
- Secretary Son.
- What the heck?

627
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.200
Why are you crying?

628
00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.640
What? What is it? What are you doing? What?

629
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.710
Hey!

630
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.400
Ah, come on...

631
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.160
Don't report this kind of thing you little...!

632
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.570
Okay, okay. I got it just get off a bit. Off, off!

633
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:02.960
I got a bunch of SNS comments all of a sudden.

634
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:09.270
They're saying I'm so poor...

635
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:14.140
yet why did I have to have two kids...

636
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:22.110
Our Han Byeol... Saying that I'm trying to benefit from turning Han Byeol into a celebrity...

637
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:27.240
I really never thought anything like that before.

638
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.170
It's just that Han Byeol is so cute

639
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:37.460
I just wanted to upload her singing...

640
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.420
That nasty mouth attached himself near you now, I see.

641
00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.650
They all keep talking about me like that

642
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:47.840
so I really feel like I'm a piece of trash.

643
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:54.530
- Get a hold of yourself! Hm? Are you trash?
- Nooo.

644
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.960
Don't get swayed by those mere words!

645
00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:03.220
- I'll go and rip that blabbermouth to shreds for you. Then it'll be fine, right?
- Y-Yeah.

646
00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.830
Don't cry anymore!

647
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:09.260
You're going through a lot of difficulty because Son Oh Gong, aren't you?

648
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:14.980
I called you here because I had something to tell you that will reassure you.

649
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:21.770
There's something about Geumganggo that you are still unaware of.

650
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.340
What is it?

651
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:28.720
Geumganggo will cease to exist on its own the moment you complete your summons.

652
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.640
This is a matter that the heavenly realm, myself, Ma Wang, and Son Oh Gong

653
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.760
are all in agreement about so you can believe it.

654
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:41.020
And there is nothing you need to worry about in regards to Song Oh Gong after Geumganggo is gone.

655
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.670
Once you've completed your summons you will no longer be Sam Jang

656
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.680
so he'll have no reason to eat you. Son Oh Gong will have

657
00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.810
absolutely no interest in you anymore.

658
00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:54.700
I see.

659
00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.270
Everything's been pre-determined to be over that way.

660
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:01.910
Do you feel reassured now?

661
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.990
Yes. That's relieving.

662
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:36.430
She doesn't look particularly reassured or even happy.

663
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:41.900
What Sam Jang was scared of wasn't being eaten.

664
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:47.850
The feelings that would disappear together with Geumganggo

665
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:52.940
She was scared of losing that.

666
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:11.520
So everything really is going to go away.

667
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.900
That's really reassuring.

668
00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.840
Aren't you going home? Again with the cell phone?

669
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.660
Shut up!

670
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.250
I know you're in here.

671
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.640
Don't bother wasting your strength and just come out.

672
00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.710
Don't interfere and just get lost!

673
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:49.530
If you bother me, I'll start talking about you!

674
00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:56.090
Hey, I'm not scared one bit of your blabbering.

675
00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:57.800
Even though everything I say comes true?

676
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:02.740
That scandalmongering mouth of yours that needlessly blabbers and needlessly creates problems,

677
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.700
I'll turn it into something there really is no need for.

678
00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:20.810
Here you are. It's there, right? Put it down when I'm being nice to you.

679
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.890
When all I have is my mouth,

680
00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:25.890
I'm no match for the Great Sage, of course.

681
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.850
Son Oh Gong will die by Sam Jang's hands.

682
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:57.570
You're going to be killed by that woman.

683
00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:02.500
You're going to die. That woman will kill you.

684
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.770
Son Oh Gong is going to be killed by Sam Jang.

685
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:12.780
That's the woman. The one that will kill you.

686
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:22.100
That woman is going to kill you.

687
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.680
I'm telling you you're going to be killed by that woman.

688
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.630
Son Oh Gong will die by Sam Jang's hand.

689
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:39.070
That woman is going to kill you.

690
00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:43.970
I'm telling you you're going to be killed by that woman.

691
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.770
Son Oh Gong will die by Sam Jang's hands.

692
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.790
Are you all right?

693
00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:14.640
That thing just now was the evil spirit that attacked Lee Han Joo, wasn't it?

694
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:19.490
It looked like he was saying something to you. What did he say?

695
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:26.230
What's wrong? What did he say that made you like this?

696
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:35.330
He said that you like me.

697
00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:39.230
That's ridiculous.

698
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:42.400
You know that Dokchwi's only say things that aren't true, right?

699
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.410
- That's definitely not true.
- It's definitely not true?

700
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.790
Of course! Definitely not!

701
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:50.980
You should never believe what a Dokchwi says!

702
00:59:55.270 --> 01:00:00.610
All right. I'll never believe it then.

703
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.690
He said you'll kill me.

704
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:11.900
Now that I think about it, you're the only thing in this world that can kill me.

705
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.800
Because if you tell me to die, I'll die.

706
01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:28.740
I'll never allow that. There's no way that'll happen.

707
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.000
Don't ever do that.

708
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:37.940
And don't leave me behind.

709
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.980
Don't leave me behind to go to another man.

710
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:46.410
If you do it one more time I might actually die.

711
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.760
All right.

712
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:53.650
Since as long you're wearing that, your heart will hurt from it.

713
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.690
Don't get angry at me or hate me.

714
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.930
I'm saying that it really hurts me.

715
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:06.650
I got it. I won't do that.

716
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.530
I love you, Jin Seon Mi.

717
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:19.280
Yes, I know. Thank you.

718
01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.860
<i>Dispatch The Birth of The New Year's First Top Star Couple</i>

719
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.410
- Alice
- PK Alice

720
01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:36.400
<i>[ PK Alice in rosy colored love ]</i>

721
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.120
<i>[ "PK Alice in rosy colored love" Pass or fail? ]</i>

722
01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.210
The first scandal of the year is between a pig and octopus. The human beings must not even have an inkling of an idea.

723
01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:46.110
They're talking so much about it because they don't know.

724
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:48.170
No eyes and ears...

725
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:51.590
they have to be like Dokchi who knows nothing but only rambles on...

726
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:53.760
in order for them to dare to ramble on just as recklessly.

727
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.170
Scandals involving celebrities are bound to pass even if you gossip without knowing the truth,

728
01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:02.190
but if an evil spirit like Dokchi meddles in the important matters of the human world...

729
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:04.010
That is when it becomes a serious problem.

730
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:07.320
If an evil spirit like that were to attach itself to a very influential figure

731
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.390
The world could experience a huge disarrangement.

732
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:14.840
That's right. Countries that came to ruins because evil spirits took over the kings...

733
01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.870
I've seen so many of them.

734
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:21.270
Professor Kang, because you showed interest in this news item...

735
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.790
it's helped greatly at putting a spotlight on the issue.

736
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:28.110
Of course, I should help out in matters that rectifies history.

737
01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.140
Yes, Secretary Ma.

738
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.930
I've just arrived in front of the broadcasting station.

739
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:40.530
Thank you for letting me see how the recordings are done.

740
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.030
I'll come up right away.

741
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.630
The car from back then?

742
01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.140
What are you doing?

743
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:43.380
- Are you the owner of this car?
- Yes.

744
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:48.540
Do you perhaps know me?

745
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:51.990
I asked if you knew me.

746
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:55.240
Then, do you know me?

747
01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.130
Of course I know you.

748
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.090
I saw your appearances on TV.

749
01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:03.490
You're a really successful person.

750
01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:10.880
Thank you. However, I don't think I recognize you.

751
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.210
Ah, I must have memorized the licence plate number wrong...

752
01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:17.660
since my brain is rotting.

753
01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.970
I'm sorry.

754
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.040
Did something go wrong?

755
01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:41.610
Looks like business is going well. You've gotten more items.

756
01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:43.920
Yeah. Aeryeong is a real hit.

757
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.020
You said that's the thing that the Birth Grandmother used, right?

758
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:50.280
A bell that lets you know who your soulmate is?

759
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.640
Yeah.

760
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.400
But can you actually those things to normal people?

761
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.820
Of course not! That's why I'm selling them secretly.

762
01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.390
As suspected, these are dangerous things.

763
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:04.030
That's why I called some people.

764
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:10.230
You told on me! Damn it...

765
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:13.290
That rascal! Secretary Ma, catch him! Run!

766
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.050
Yes.

767
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:25.490
I'm going to get points from this as well. Thank you.

768
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:26.990
Don't mention it!

769
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:30.470
I have to do well until I fulfill all of Sam Jang's summons.

770
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:34.590
It looks like everything is fine with you and Son Oh Gong.

771
01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:37.580
Yeah. We reconciled and now we're okay.

772
01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.630
My worries about what comes after I take off the Geumganggo have disappeared.

773
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.870
I don't have any expectations either. My heart is at ease.

774
01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:49.290
That's a relief. Well, then.

He must've dropped it.

776
01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.480
You're saying you were selling these valuables for 3,000 Won?

777
01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:20.610
And I was the one that caught him. Please be certain to take care of the main point here.

778
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:26.480
- Huh? It's not here!
- What?

779
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.580
Huh?

780
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.730
Is this the thing that lets you know your soulmate?

781
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:36.380
Aeryeong?

782
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.720
It's not a Love Bell. What disappeared was the Black Bell!

783
01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.930
If it was the black one... Saryeong?

784
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:51.330
If it's the Saryeong, are we talking about the bell that the grim reaper uses?
[ Saryeong: The Bell of Death ]

785
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:56.500
That's right. It's a bell that lets you know a very scary fated connection.

786
01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:02.790
It's said that when you meet your fated death bringer,

787
01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:05.970
you can hear the sound of Saryeong's bell.

788
01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.010
What's with this?

789
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.910
When the one to die,

790
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:52.020
and the one that has the fate to kill the other meet

791
01:08:55.050 --> 01:09:00.670
the sound of Saryeong's ringing can be heard.
