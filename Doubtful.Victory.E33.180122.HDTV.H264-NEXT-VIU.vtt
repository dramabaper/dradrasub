00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.151
(All the characters, organizations, places, and happenings...)

2
00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:08.611
(in this drama are all fake and are not based on a true story.)

3
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.520
(Arrest Warrant)

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.420
We have an arrest warrant for Jang Pil Sung.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.420
Take him away.

6
00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.207
Who are you?

7
00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.277
Get out!

8
00:00:27.317 --> 00:00:30.617
Congressman, I will protect you!

9
00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:33.387
Get out!

10
00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:36.287
Jang Pil Sung!

11
00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:40.728
No.

12
00:01:09.518 --> 00:01:10.587
What's wrong?

13
00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:13.298
The person Mr. Cha killed...

14
00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:18.927
is my mother.

15
00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:25.337
Congressman Lee Kwang Ho ordered me to murder...

16
00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:30.707
a mother and a son who doesn't have a place to live.

17
00:01:31.248 --> 00:01:33.477
- The woman's name is... - "The woman's name is..."

18
00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.177
- Choi... - "Choi..."

19
00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:36.477
- Yeon... - "Yeon..."

20
00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:37.787
- Mi. - "Mi".

21
00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:42.817
Mom.

22
00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:44.457
Mom!

23
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.257
Mom!

24
00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:50.768
Mom! Mom!

25
00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:21.958
(Episode 33)

26
00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:37.007
Choi Yeon...

27
00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:42.778
Choi Yeon Mi.

28
00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:45.188
Do you know her?

29
00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:52.058
This woman...

30
00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:53.058
(The woman's name is Choi Yeon Mi.)

31
00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:55.458
20 years ago, on a rainy night...

32
00:02:57.827 --> 00:02:58.868
Why...

33
00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:01.838
did you kill her?

34
00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:11.007
I can't...

35
00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:13.718
tell you.

36
00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:16.517
I already know everything. Did Lee Kwang Ho tell you to kill her?

37
00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:20.417
What was the reason?

38
00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:22.887
Why did he order you to kill her?

39
00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:25.958
I don't know.

40
00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:28.158
I really don't.

41
00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:31.727
I never asked him why.

42
00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:35.197
And he never told me why.

43
00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:38.037
Then why didn't you kill the child?

44
00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:41.037
It says here that you were ordered to kill both of them.

45
00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:42.107
That's because...

46
00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:48.317
I figured that...

47
00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:53.017
the boy couldn't have done anything wrong.

48
00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:55.017
Then...

49
00:03:55.887 --> 00:03:56.987
what about Choi Yeon Mi?

50
00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:00.528
What did she do wrong?

51
00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:03.428
You said you didn't know why he wanted her killed!

52
00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:05.498
How could you kill her just because he told you to?

53
00:04:09.868 --> 00:04:10.938
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:13.737
Sir, I'm sorry.

55
00:04:15.737 --> 00:04:18.778
Please forgive me. I have sinned.

56
00:04:18.778 --> 00:04:20.778
And please bless me with your grace.

57
00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:23.218
I'll live a kind life from now on.

58
00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:26.148
I pray in your name. Amen.

59
00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:27.658
Hey, Mr. Cha Gwang Tae.

60
00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:32.127
Where's Gook Su Ran?

61
00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.458
Please ask her to come.

62
00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:38.627
I'll tell her everything.

63
00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:42.367
- Gook Su Ran? - Yes.

64
00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:46.307
She saved my life.

65
00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:51.078
I'm not going to...

66
00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:54.677
say anything to anyone other than Gook Su Ran.

67
00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:01.417
Please forgive me. I have sinned.

68
00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.258
And please bless me with your grace.

69
00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:05.287
I'll live a kind life from now on.

70
00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:17.107
Dad.

71
00:05:19.737 --> 00:05:21.778
Please postpone the business operation in Tunisia.

72
00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:24.508
I can't believe I even think of you as my son.

73
00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:38.287
Here.

74
00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:43.598
Su Chil.

75
00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:49.568
I've been working with you as a cop for over 10 years.

76
00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:54.237
But I really can't hide how disappointed I am today.

77
00:05:57.547 --> 00:05:58.708
My gosh.

78
00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:01.818
It's okay. Things like this can happen. Drink up.

79
00:06:02.617 --> 00:06:04.917
Inspector Park. Sergeant Kim.

80
00:06:05.888 --> 00:06:07.258
I'm so sorry.

81
00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:11.088
We lost both Jang Pil Sung and General Manager Kwak.

82
00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:16.158
On top of that, I got beaten up. I'm so ashamed of myself.

83
00:06:21.838 --> 00:06:24.568
I'm really sorry, you guys.

84
00:06:24.568 --> 00:06:25.568
No.

85
00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:28.578
I'm the one who's sorry.

86
00:06:30.948 --> 00:06:32.708
What are you doing? Are you crying?

87
00:06:33.008 --> 00:06:34.448
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:34.877 --> 00:06:35.877
What?

89
00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:38.047
What's he saying?

90
00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:40.617
Just let him cry.

91
00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:44.388
A shot of soju is his limit.

92
00:06:44.557 --> 00:06:46.388
Is he acting like this because he's drunk?

93
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:49.698
Drink up.

94
00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:52.367
I got so angry earlier...

95
00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:54.537
on our way to catch Lee Kwang Ho.

96
00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:56.667
I get that he was already rich.

97
00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.508
And I don't care that he used that money...

98
00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:00.877
to buy a land in the middle of Seoul and build a house there.

99
00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:02.508
But I don't get why...

100
00:07:02.908 --> 00:07:07.348
he uses our people's taxes to hire his bodyguards.

101
00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:11.948
Those guys who were protecting him are the same cops as us.

102
00:07:11.948 --> 00:07:15.487
Hey, be quiet. We're at a public place.

103
00:07:16.528 --> 00:07:17.588
Hey.

104
00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:21.057
That's how our country's law works.

105
00:07:21.898 --> 00:07:23.098
What did Mr. Cha say?

106
00:07:24.968 --> 00:07:27.198
I think Lee Kwang Ho ordered him to do it.

107
00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:29.598
But I don't think he knows why.

108
00:07:31.768 --> 00:07:35.508
Lee Kwang Ho wouldn't have told him why he wanted her dead.

109
00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:37.948
But there's one thing that bothers me.

110
00:07:39.107 --> 00:07:41.778
My mom didn't die because of a hit and run.

111
00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:42.818
Really?

112
00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:46.287
Then there must be a record of her accident. I'll look for it.

113
00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:50.057
Is there anything else...

114
00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:53.698
you remember about your mom?

115
00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:57.098
Anything that seems weird now that you think of it.

116
00:07:58.468 --> 00:08:01.667
When I think back of my childhood, everything was weird.

117
00:08:02.468 --> 00:08:05.768
But I never knew that it had anything to do with Lee Kwang Ho.

118
00:08:06.537 --> 00:08:07.937
What was weird?

119
00:08:09.607 --> 00:08:11.107
We were homeless.

120
00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:21.388
Mom, this place is clean. Let's sleep here tonight.

121
00:08:22.057 --> 00:08:23.557
Okay.

122
00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:36.568
You didn't brush your teeth.

123
00:08:36.568 --> 00:08:37.907
Here you go.

124
00:08:38.407 --> 00:08:42.137
You need to brush it like this 30 times.

125
00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:44.708
I know. You always tell me that.

126
00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:47.977
- Here. You should do it too. - Okay.

127
00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:05.428
Don't look at me like that. I didn't suffer at all back then.

128
00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:07.637
My mom was always with me by my side.

129
00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:12.367
We'd chat and have fun all night in public bathrooms.

130
00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:14.637
She also taught me how to read.

131
00:09:14.977 --> 00:09:17.708
Have you ever tried asking the police or city hall for help?

132
00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:20.678
There was no need to because we got arrested all the time.

133
00:09:21.517 --> 00:09:25.088
People always reported us for sleeping in a public bathroom.

134
00:09:25.688 --> 00:09:28.017
There were times when we got taken to the police station.

135
00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:29.517
And...

136
00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:34.058
some people from a welfare center also came and talked to us.

137
00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:37.168
They even got us a place to stay.

138
00:09:37.968 --> 00:09:41.068
But a few days later, my mom and I ran away from that place.

139
00:09:42.168 --> 00:09:45.367
Do you think she was trying to run away from Lee Kwang Ho?

140
00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:48.477
Now that I think about it, yes.

141
00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:52.178
I wonder why.

142
00:09:53.818 --> 00:09:56.918
And how did your mom know Lee Kwang Ho?

143
00:09:58.117 --> 00:09:59.117
I don't know.

144
00:10:03.527 --> 00:10:05.357
We have to find another way.

145
00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:07.997
Like what?

146
00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:09.828
We'll make Mr. Cha...

147
00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:14.168
remember.

148
00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:27.848
You're starting to grow on me.

149
00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:30.288
Because I've been looking at you all day.

150
00:10:31.887 --> 00:10:35.487
Chairman Gook. The 48 hours are almost up.

151
00:10:36.357 --> 00:10:39.897
Either you will be investigated without physical detention...

152
00:10:40.757 --> 00:10:43.798
or you will be given an arrest warrant,

153
00:10:43.798 --> 00:10:46.068
and be investigated in lockup.

154
00:10:46.838 --> 00:10:49.168
The proof I have is very useful.

155
00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:50.938
So they'll issue an arrest warrant right away.

156
00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:56.107
Are you ready to sleep in a lockup starting tonight?

157
00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:08.318
Will you two say "Stop!" again?

158
00:11:09.257 --> 00:11:12.727
I won't let you. I won't be fooled twice.

159
00:11:18.727 --> 00:11:19.767
What's that?

160
00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:22.068
It's Mr. Cha's notebook.

161
00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:24.168
It's a record of all the things he did for Lee Kwang Ho.

162
00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:28.777
I can't believe you brought this to me.

163
00:11:30.078 --> 00:11:32.377
You must've been worried that I'd go astray.

164
00:11:32.877 --> 00:11:35.147
I didn't bring it for you.

165
00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:39.548
It's for Chairman Gook.

166
00:11:42.288 --> 00:11:44.657
You put it on my desk which means it's for me.

167
00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:46.997
Don't deny it.

168
00:11:52.997 --> 00:11:54.668
This is amazing.

169
00:11:57.438 --> 00:11:58.708
Where's the other half?

170
00:11:59.938 --> 00:12:02.237
Where is Mr. Cha?

171
00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:04.948
If we get him to testify to back this up...

172
00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:06.078
That's why I'm here.

173
00:12:07.147 --> 00:12:08.247
Release her...

174
00:12:09.578 --> 00:12:11.017
for one day.

175
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:16.887
He said he would tell us everything if he sees Chairwoman Gook.

176
00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:22.897
Release her to get an Alzheimer's patient to testify?

177
00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:25.897
He does tell truth time to time.

178
00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:29.568
General Manager Kwak has the rest of the notes.

179
00:12:29.838 --> 00:12:31.538
If we're going to do anything with the notebook...

180
00:12:31.538 --> 00:12:34.538
You're saying Chairwoman Gook has to be released.

181
00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:37.448
Yes.

182
00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:43.688
What if we get nothing out of her release?

183
00:12:44.517 --> 00:12:47.887
There should be some kind of collateral.

184
00:12:48.657 --> 00:12:49.718
I'll...

185
00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:53.958
give you want you want then.

186
00:12:56.157 --> 00:12:57.328
For example?

187
00:12:57.627 --> 00:12:58.997
Like a press conference.

188
00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:04.237
With proof that Manager Lee and the NIS had a long relationship.

189
00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:06.938
Then you'll have to be...

190
00:13:06.938 --> 00:13:08.637
put in jail as well.

191
00:13:09.607 --> 00:13:12.548
That's why you haven't talked all this time.

192
00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:14.548
Why would you bring yourself down now?

193
00:13:15.318 --> 00:13:17.517
I can't trust you.

194
00:13:26.058 --> 00:13:28.257
Gosh, you're making it difficult.

195
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.367
I'll make sure to bring her back.

196
00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:33.637
No. I'll tag along.

197
00:13:34.568 --> 00:13:37.168
There is nothing else I can do at this time anyway.

198
00:13:42.977 --> 00:13:46.247
You should call General Manager Kwak first.

199
00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:53.588
I'm sorry, sir. I was trying to run away from the police.

200
00:13:53.718 --> 00:13:56.357
Thanks to these men I was safe.

201
00:13:57.088 --> 00:13:59.088
Anyway, thanks to you, sir...

202
00:13:59.157 --> 00:14:00.558
You may leave the room.

203
00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:08.698
I couldn't get the whole thing. This is all I have.

204
00:14:10.607 --> 00:14:11.637
That's fine.

205
00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:13.507
You should leave.

206
00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:17.407
Yes, sir.

207
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:30.431
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E33 Doubtful Victory "He Killed My Mom"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

208
00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:41.168
Mr. Cha.

209
00:14:42.438 --> 00:14:44.068
That little...

210
00:14:50.678 --> 00:14:51.877
It's me, Attorney An.

211
00:14:52.548 --> 00:14:54.178
There's something you should look into.

212
00:14:55.418 --> 00:14:57.147
(Erim Food)

213
00:15:03.657 --> 00:15:05.257
Where's the other half of the notebook?

214
00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:07.357
I heard you took it.

215
00:15:11.568 --> 00:15:13.127
You can tell me.

216
00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:15.867
Well... The thing is...

217
00:15:16.137 --> 00:15:19.107
The guards caught me, and I was brought to Manager Lee.

218
00:15:22.107 --> 00:15:23.747
I didn't mean to give it to him.

219
00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:25.348
Whether you meant to or not,

220
00:15:25.907 --> 00:15:28.977
what matters is that it's with Lee Kwang Ho now.

221
00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:30.987
You're right, but...

222
00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:33.588
I read what was written on it,

223
00:15:33.718 --> 00:15:35.117
and there wasn't anything crucial.

224
00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:36.458
That's possible.

225
00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:39.288
It was right before the presidential election,

226
00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:40.928
so he laid low at the time.

227
00:15:41.657 --> 00:15:45.798
All Mr. Cha did was delivering money.

228
00:15:48.938 --> 00:15:50.137
You can go.

229
00:15:52.107 --> 00:15:53.107
Okay.

230
00:15:57.578 --> 00:15:59.107
So that means...

231
00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:03.387
based on what Mr. Cha wrote in the notebook,

232
00:16:03.718 --> 00:16:07.387
we have to find cases that can bring Lee Kwang Ho down.

233
00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:13.657
Then which case will you go after first?

234
00:16:19.227 --> 00:16:20.497
(I buried a 3-year-old kid.)

235
00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:23.968
The kid who died?

236
00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.607
But I don't think...

237
00:16:27.438 --> 00:16:29.777
Lee Kwang Ho has anything to do with that case.

238
00:16:30.777 --> 00:16:33.777
It just says he buried a kid on this date.

239
00:16:34.218 --> 00:16:37.117
It says nothing about Lee Kwang Ho's order.

240
00:16:37.117 --> 00:16:38.588
Yes, he gave an order.

241
00:16:38.588 --> 00:16:40.257
Lee Kwang Ho killed the kid too.

242
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.487
What?

243
00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:43.428
Who was that kid?

244
00:16:45.727 --> 00:16:47.357
The boy Lee Kwang Ho adopted.

245
00:16:48.397 --> 00:16:49.968
The real Lee Young Min.

246
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:54.568
Then what about the Lee Young Min I put in the psychiatric ward?

247
00:16:54.767 --> 00:16:55.867
He's a fake.

248
00:16:57.137 --> 00:16:59.607
He couldn't say he killed the boy he adopted.

249
00:16:59.907 --> 00:17:02.578
So he secretly brought another boy to raise.

250
00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:06.578
So we find where the boy is buried,

251
00:17:06.578 --> 00:17:08.717
find his body, and... Wait.

252
00:17:10.748 --> 00:17:12.717
The statute of limitations already expired.

253
00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:15.758
We can't arrest him with that.

254
00:17:15.758 --> 00:17:16.788
However,

255
00:17:17.387 --> 00:17:19.028
if you can prove that...

256
00:17:19.028 --> 00:17:21.058
what's written here is true,

257
00:17:21.998 --> 00:17:25.498
then the public will want the other cases checked too.

258
00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:28.937
By manipulating media,

259
00:17:28.937 --> 00:17:30.607
you can agitate Lee Kwang Ho...

260
00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:33.578
and put pressure on the leaders of the prosecution office.

261
00:17:36.038 --> 00:17:39.147
Finding the dead body of the kid...

262
00:17:39.147 --> 00:17:41.048
will be the most effective way.

263
00:17:42.447 --> 00:17:45.387
We just need to find out where Mr. Cha buried him.

264
00:17:45.617 --> 00:17:46.617
But...

265
00:17:47.217 --> 00:17:50.488
how can we confirm this boy was the one Lee Kwang Ho adopted?

266
00:17:51.657 --> 00:17:52.988
I know...

267
00:17:55.357 --> 00:17:56.927
whom the kid's parents are.

268
00:17:57.498 --> 00:17:59.028
I guess you already found them.

269
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:01.667
Who are they?

270
00:18:02.098 --> 00:18:05.338
I'll tell you once we find the dead body.

271
00:18:14.348 --> 00:18:15.478
A prosecutor,

272
00:18:16.417 --> 00:18:19.348
an officer, and the former Chief Director of NIS.

273
00:18:20.117 --> 00:18:22.357
What are they doing together?

274
00:18:22.687 --> 00:18:23.857
I don't know.

275
00:18:23.857 --> 00:18:25.828
You should know.

276
00:18:26.758 --> 00:18:29.228
I need to do something...

277
00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:32.228
to help Chairwoman Gook.

278
00:18:32.298 --> 00:18:34.998
Are you completely on Chairwoman Gook's side now?

279
00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:39.167
I can't side with Manager Lee all of a sudden.

280
00:18:40.038 --> 00:18:44.508
And it looks like the prosecution and the police are working with her.

281
00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:48.147
At a time like this, we should go with the government workers.

282
00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:49.917
What if we all get killed?

283
00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:52.617
That's why we have to do well, so we don't get killed.

284
00:18:53.088 --> 00:18:54.318
For example?

285
00:18:54.357 --> 00:18:58.387
For example, finding proof for Odong Blowfish House case.

286
00:18:59.927 --> 00:19:03.667
When I caught Jang Pil Sung and was bringing him to Manager Lee,

287
00:19:04.568 --> 00:19:06.328
I read all the notes.

288
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:09.167
The one who killed Ms. Hong was...

289
00:19:09.907 --> 00:19:10.967
Manager Lee.

290
00:19:13.637 --> 00:19:16.907
He strangled her. Just in case they left any evidence behind,

291
00:19:16.907 --> 00:19:20.078
Mr. Cha clipped Ms. Hong's nails.

292
00:19:21.048 --> 00:19:23.548
I'm sure that Jang Pil Sung has them.

293
00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:29.957
Hey. Get a hold of yourself.

294
00:19:30.328 --> 00:19:33.298
Both of us will get killed if we don't pay attention.

295
00:19:33.828 --> 00:19:35.028
Brace yourself.

296
00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:36.098
Okay.

297
00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:39.467
Where can we find...

298
00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:42.238
Jang Pil Sung?

299
00:19:42.238 --> 00:19:43.808
We have to find him somehow.

300
00:19:44.407 --> 00:19:47.478
We'll have a better chance at finding him than the police.

301
00:19:47.637 --> 00:19:49.877
Because we know his cloned phone number.

302
00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:52.978
We'll inquire his call history...

303
00:19:53.147 --> 00:19:54.217
and wait.

304
00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:56.078
Okay.

305
00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:01.217
(Attorney An)

306
00:20:01.988 --> 00:20:03.457
It's An Tae Jung.

307
00:20:05.028 --> 00:20:07.298
(Attorney An)

308
00:20:09.197 --> 00:20:11.967
Kim Yoon Su came out with Chairwoman Gook.

309
00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:15.298
What in the world is she up to?

310
00:20:15.937 --> 00:20:18.137
Is she turning herself in and confessing to everything?

311
00:20:18.137 --> 00:20:19.768
I'm not sure of that yet.

312
00:20:20.238 --> 00:20:22.578
I just called General Manager Kwak and checked.

313
00:20:23.177 --> 00:20:25.607
Apparently, she didn't go anywhere near Erim Food.

314
00:20:31.288 --> 00:20:32.348
Yes.

315
00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:35.288
Okay.

316
00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:39.758
Chairwoman Gook...

317
00:20:40.758 --> 00:20:42.457
went back to the District Attorney's Office.

318
00:20:42.457 --> 00:20:45.927
That means she willingly went back there...

319
00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:48.738
after she made an outing with Kim Yoon Su.

320
00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:50.367
That makes no sense.

321
00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:53.738
He should either have an arrest warrant and start investigating...

322
00:20:54.038 --> 00:20:57.947
or let go of her if that's not the case.

323
00:21:01.518 --> 00:21:03.947
She's definitely up to something.

324
00:21:06.187 --> 00:21:08.657
Are you sure she didn't visit Erim Food?

325
00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:15.528
An Tae Jung! What are you doing right now?

326
00:21:15.697 --> 00:21:17.897
You can't even tell whether General Manager Kwak is reliable or not.

327
00:21:17.897 --> 00:21:19.697
How do you even call this a report?

328
00:21:19.937 --> 00:21:20.998
I'm sorry, sir.

329
00:21:21.538 --> 00:21:23.268
Keep an eye on him...

330
00:21:24.008 --> 00:21:26.207
so that he won't think about betraying me. Do you understand?

331
00:21:26.607 --> 00:21:27.677
Yes, sir.

332
00:21:36.748 --> 00:21:39.588
My gosh, it would've been great if everything went according to plan.

333
00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:41.457
Then Lee Kwang Ho would be...

334
00:21:41.457 --> 00:21:43.427
What can you do when luck isn't on your side?

335
00:21:46.657 --> 00:21:47.697
Chul Gi.

336
00:21:48.197 --> 00:21:52.627
To be honest, I think it's useless to try so hard to find evidence.

337
00:21:53.798 --> 00:21:56.197
They're all going to get released anyway.

338
00:21:56.197 --> 00:21:57.568
And if that's not the case,

339
00:21:58.107 --> 00:22:01.207
they'll just waste time by dragging on with their trials and stuff.

340
00:22:01.308 --> 00:22:02.707
So are you just going to give up?

341
00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:06.478
Shouldn't you at least look into your mom's case?

342
00:22:06.978 --> 00:22:09.177
The statute of limitations for that is already over.

343
00:22:09.617 --> 00:22:12.117
What's the point of looking into a case that's no longer valid?

344
00:22:12.988 --> 00:22:14.018
But...

345
00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:17.088
you still need to find out why he killed her.

346
00:22:21.328 --> 00:22:22.397
I...

347
00:22:25.098 --> 00:22:27.038
just want to kill Lee Kwang Ho.

348
00:22:29.637 --> 00:22:31.268
I want to kill him.

349
00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:36.877
- I wasn't going to say this. - Go ahead, and say it.

350
00:22:39.748 --> 00:22:42.018
"I want to kill Lee Kwang Ho." "I want him dead."

351
00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:43.818
Just say it.

352
00:22:45.548 --> 00:22:46.917
Instead, just end it at that.

353
00:22:47.887 --> 00:22:49.927
It might seem like if you kill him...

354
00:22:50.427 --> 00:22:51.957
things will come to an end,

355
00:22:53.127 --> 00:22:54.197
but it won't.

356
00:22:56.697 --> 00:22:59.197
I also thought of killing him numerous times in my head.

357
00:23:01.197 --> 00:23:02.268
But...

358
00:23:02.897 --> 00:23:04.637
that's not winning.

359
00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.538
That's just losing.

360
00:23:11.407 --> 00:23:14.478
You should go to work tomorrow and work with your team.

361
00:23:14.617 --> 00:23:16.788
That's the only way you'll be able to catch him.

362
00:23:17.717 --> 00:23:19.717
I'll try looking into your mom's case separately.

363
00:23:22.217 --> 00:23:25.058
I think I'm going to sleep here tonight. That's okay, right?

364
00:24:36.328 --> 00:24:38.268
(The Mill)

365
00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:43.467
Lieutenant Jin isn't picking up.

366
00:24:44.467 --> 00:24:46.137
You could've just gone to work by yourself.

367
00:24:46.137 --> 00:24:48.877
Why did you bother coming all the way here?

368
00:24:52.308 --> 00:24:53.348
My gosh.

369
00:24:55.617 --> 00:24:58.687
Mom, you should've told me that someone's here.

370
00:24:58.687 --> 00:25:00.357
I was going to.

371
00:25:00.357 --> 00:25:02.357
But you were a bit too quick.

372
00:25:05.957 --> 00:25:09.127
I'll get going then.

373
00:25:09.298 --> 00:25:11.028
- Did you eat? - Pardon?

374
00:25:11.028 --> 00:25:13.127
- Did you eat breakfast? - No.

375
00:25:15.437 --> 00:25:17.268
It's okay, ma'am.

376
00:25:19.407 --> 00:25:21.877
It's not okay. Come inside.

377
00:25:22.937 --> 00:25:25.008
You guys are partners,

378
00:25:25.008 --> 00:25:28.548
so I'll be nice to my daughter's coworker.

379
00:25:28.917 --> 00:25:31.348
Come inside. I just need to heat the soup.

380
00:25:32.687 --> 00:25:33.988
It's... It's okay.

381
00:25:33.988 --> 00:25:35.157
Come inside.

382
00:25:35.717 --> 00:25:37.687
I also have something to tell you.

383
00:25:37.687 --> 00:25:38.687
Okay.

384
00:25:38.687 --> 00:25:40.758
Keep the door open even if you're just coworkers.

385
00:25:40.957 --> 00:25:42.357
A grown man and woman shouldn't...

386
00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:54.377
I looked everywhere for that after you left.

387
00:25:54.478 --> 00:25:55.607
This is...

388
00:25:55.738 --> 00:25:56.808
That's right.

389
00:25:57.348 --> 00:25:59.207
It's the record of your mom's accident.

390
00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:02.478
That record is from 20 years ago, so it's not in the best state.

391
00:26:03.647 --> 00:26:06.488
But look here. It says that the assailant is Cha Gwang Tae.

392
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:09.417
He got caught in the crime scene, which means you were right.

393
00:26:11.588 --> 00:26:13.298
But the important thing is that...

394
00:26:13.298 --> 00:26:16.967
he got caught in the scene when he could've just drove away.

395
00:26:17.127 --> 00:26:19.897
If it was a hit-and-run, the cops would've started investigating.

396
00:26:20.197 --> 00:26:22.268
But I guess he didn't want my mom to get investigated.

397
00:26:22.568 --> 00:26:24.667
Bingo. That's exactly what I think.

398
00:26:25.038 --> 00:26:29.808
It means he didn't want the cops investigating your mom.

399
00:26:29.808 --> 00:26:30.848
And that reason...

400
00:26:30.848 --> 00:26:34.348
It'll be the same reason why Lee Kwang Ho tried to kill my mom.

401
00:26:34.917 --> 00:26:35.947
Exactly.

402
00:26:37.617 --> 00:26:40.887
But I couldn't find a single record about you.

403
00:26:43.887 --> 00:26:46.127
Maybe Cha Gwang Tae never mentioned me in his testimony.

404
00:26:46.558 --> 00:26:49.498
He left me alive when he had been ordered to kill me.

405
00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:52.028
So in order to keep that hidden,

406
00:26:52.268 --> 00:26:54.367
he could've just left that out of his testimony.

407
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.238
I guess that could be a possibility.

408
00:26:56.637 --> 00:26:58.508
What did you do after that happened?

409
00:26:58.508 --> 00:26:59.607
I ran away...

410
00:26:59.877 --> 00:27:02.377
because some woman said she was going to send me to an orphanage.

411
00:27:03.407 --> 00:27:07.117
By any chance, was her name Kim Kkot Bi?

412
00:27:07.647 --> 00:27:09.377
I don't know. Why?

413
00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:12.417
Because it says here that someone came and made an agreement.

414
00:27:12.417 --> 00:27:13.657
Her name was Kim Kkot Bi.

415
00:27:13.657 --> 00:27:15.088
She claimed that she was your mom's friend.

416
00:27:15.088 --> 00:27:17.558
My mom's friend came and made an agreement?

417
00:27:17.558 --> 00:27:19.758
Yes. So from now on,

418
00:27:19.927 --> 00:27:23.328
we need to look into both your mom and Kim Kkot Bi.

419
00:27:24.397 --> 00:27:28.238
Let's leave that to Chul Gi. He said he'd look into it.

420
00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:33.278
We didn't tell Inspector Park every single detail.

421
00:27:35.207 --> 00:27:37.177
Don't you think we should?

422
00:27:38.147 --> 00:27:39.647
Let's wait until things become a bit clearer.

423
00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:44.147
Then, we can tell him that the woman who died back then was my mom...

424
00:27:44.548 --> 00:27:46.917
and that the boy who Lee Kwang Ho had ordered...

425
00:27:47.657 --> 00:27:49.617
to kill was me.

426
00:27:50.788 --> 00:27:54.298
Let's give Chul Gi everything we have about my mom's death.

427
00:27:54.998 --> 00:27:56.228
And let's see how things unravel.

428
00:27:56.927 --> 00:27:57.927
Okay.

429
00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:05.407
What were you guys doing? What's with the mood?

430
00:28:06.877 --> 00:28:07.978
Eat breakfast.

431
00:28:11.248 --> 00:28:12.377
It's tasty.

432
00:28:12.808 --> 00:28:14.318
Oh, okay.

433
00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:16.417
Gosh, don't touch him.

434
00:28:20.887 --> 00:28:22.988
Now, the first thing...

435
00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:26.357
we have to do is to catch Jang Pil Sung.

436
00:28:26.897 --> 00:28:30.197
According to Mr. Cha's memo...

437
00:28:31.068 --> 00:28:33.338
Hey, come over here.

438
00:28:33.738 --> 00:28:35.098
Look this way.

439
00:28:35.998 --> 00:28:39.268
Let's say she's Ms. Hong and I'm Lee Kwang Ho.

440
00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:41.907
He started off with choking her.

441
00:28:42.278 --> 00:28:44.078
See? This is what he did to her.

442
00:28:44.078 --> 00:28:46.278
Then she can't help but react to this.

443
00:28:46.377 --> 00:28:49.318
That's right. If she did this, it's highly possible that...

444
00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:52.318
Lee Kwang Ho's DNA was left in her nails.

445
00:28:52.318 --> 00:28:55.318
That's exactly why Mr. Cha cut her nails.

446
00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:56.687
Inspector Park!

447
00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:58.558
Gosh, I'm sorry.

448
00:29:03.157 --> 00:29:04.667
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

449
00:29:05.467 --> 00:29:06.568
My gosh.

450
00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:10.508
That means her nails has to be out there somewhere.

451
00:29:10.508 --> 00:29:13.338
Yes. Jang Pil Sung probably has them...

452
00:29:13.338 --> 00:29:16.707
since it could be used as crucial evidence.

453
00:29:16.707 --> 00:29:20.778
That's right. That's why we need to catch Jang Pil Sung first.

454
00:29:20.778 --> 00:29:24.018
Then why didn't he mention that when he suggested...

455
00:29:24.018 --> 00:29:25.488
Officer Oh to make a deal with him?

456
00:29:25.687 --> 00:29:29.088
I guess it's because Mr. Cha's notebook was enough to make a deal.

457
00:29:29.187 --> 00:29:30.528
That's exactly right.

458
00:29:30.828 --> 00:29:33.728
Judging from Jang Pil Sung's behavioral pattern,

459
00:29:33.728 --> 00:29:36.298
it's highly possible that he's keeping it so that...

460
00:29:36.528 --> 00:29:38.728
he can use it when he has no other choice.

461
00:29:38.728 --> 00:29:39.867
I knew it.

462
00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:43.867
That's why we've been searching all the nearby CCTV footages. Right?

463
00:29:43.867 --> 00:29:46.407
So please give us a hand, okay?

464
00:29:46.407 --> 00:29:48.338
No, you guys can finish that off.

465
00:29:48.338 --> 00:29:52.778
I want Lieutenant Jin and Officer Oh to look into Ms. Hong.

466
00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:56.518
We need to know about her to find Lee Kwang Ho's motive for murder.

467
00:29:56.518 --> 00:29:59.387
It'll be useless if we don't find out his motive behind all this.

468
00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:01.588
It's not like Lee Kwang Ho will tell us everything first.

469
00:30:01.617 --> 00:30:03.117
- Okay. - Get going.

470
00:30:03.788 --> 00:30:06.657
Are we going to stop investigating Mr. Cha?

471
00:30:07.581 --> 00:30:10.681
(Episode 34 will air shortly.)
