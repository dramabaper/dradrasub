1
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.743
Let's eat baeksuk for dinner.

2
00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:10.103
(Sung Kyu is excited to eat baeksuk.)

3
00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:12.242
(A Korean chicken from Gangwon Province)

4
00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:13.912
That looks so good.

5
00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:17.183
(Gyeong Gyu, the master of chicken, said he'd cook.)

6
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.953
(He was touched and anticipating.)

7
00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:20.652
(But Sung Kyu is washing the rice.)

8
00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:22.222
- Am I doing it correctly? - What?

9
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.222
(Will Sung Kyu be cooking again?)

10
00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.562
(Gyeong Gyu is scanning the fridge.)

11
00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:32.093
(Let me see.)

12
00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:36.503
(When Sung Kyu leaves the kitchen for a while, )

13
00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.503
(Gyeong Gyu is trying to make good on his promise and cook.)

14
00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:43.842
(They are on watch to see if Sung Kyu is coming back.)

15
00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:45.342
(So far, there's no sign of him.)

16
00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:48.143
(He busily moves his hands...)

17
00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:49.582
(to clean the abalones.)

18
00:00:50.213 --> 00:00:53.783
(He cleans the pine mushroom with his fancy knife skills.)

19
00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:56.283
(Before he puts it on the table, )

20
00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.122
(he checks how fresh it is himself.)

21
00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:00.122
(It's decent enough.)

22
00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:03.122
(He takes another bite since it's delicious.)

23
00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:07.803
(His healthy teeth and the mushroom make a lilting sound.)

24
00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:10.502
(All right. This is excellent.)

25
00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:13.002
(Sung Kyu comes back to help.)

26
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.073
- What should I do? - There's nothing for you to do.

27
00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:16.543
- Really? - Yes.

28
00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:17.973
Hey.

29
00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:20.883
Should I take out the chicken?

30
00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:22.183
- Pardon? - Should I take out the chicken?

31
00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.053
- The chicken? - Yes, that's the last step.

32
00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:27.723
(Because of Sung Kyu, who can't stop himself from helping, )

33
00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:30.152
(there's no time for him to waste.)

34
00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:33.762
(The way he washes the garlics displays how experienced he is.)

35
00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.293
(Sung Kyu is still trying to understand what's going on.)

36
00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.463
(He puts the garlics he washed into the pot.)

37
00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.463
(Without any fancy trick, he throws them into the pot.)

38
00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:43.603
Let's just do this.

39
00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:46.103
(Sung Kyu takes out the chicken.)

40
00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:49.372
(Gyeong Gyu intercepts it and washes it.)

41
00:01:50.913 --> 00:01:53.112
(There is no delay in the speed he takes care of things.)

42
00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.543
(There is literally nothing for me to do.)

43
00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:00.183
You saw the abalones, right?

44
00:02:00.183 --> 00:02:01.583
Yes, the abalones.

45
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:03.993
(How did he find these?)

46
00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:05.823
My gosh, this is the best.

47
00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:08.262
All we need to do is wait for it to boil.

48
00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:09.593
(Is he going to cook chicken baeksuk with abalones?)

49
00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:11.992
With the abalones?

50
00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:14.533
Sorry? Wait, no. Don't put them in yet because...

51
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:18.633
we need to boil this for 20 minutes, and they are going to get mushy.

52
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:22.242
(I can't just stand here and watch.)

53
00:02:23.103 --> 00:02:26.943
(It's a moment the "Gyu" Brothers come together.)

54
00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:28.982
Don't you think it's going to be too much?

55
00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.182
That's good. That's enough.

56
00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.522
(The chicken is ready to be cooked.)

57
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:35.653
Let's wait now.

58
00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:40.052
(After watching Gyeong Gyu cook without hesitation...)

59
00:02:40.052 --> 00:02:41.262
Give it 20 minutes.

60
00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:44.462
- 20 minutes? Why am I so hungry? - What did you say?

61
00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:46.563
- I did nothing, but I'm hungry. - Is that so?

62
00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:48.932
- You worked out. - Right. That must be it.

63
00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:50.262
(Gyeong Gyu's chicken baeksuk is ready!)

64
00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:52.373
It's 6:20pm.

65
00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:55.043
We can have the baeksuk, and it will be all good then.

66
00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:59.413
(They feel slightly bored while waiting.)

67
00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:02.443
Gyeong Gyu, did you always want to become a comedian?

68
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:03.653
- No. - Was it a film director?

69
00:03:03.653 --> 00:03:06.853
No, no. I wanted to become...

70
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.022
Was it a movie actor?

71
00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.892
No. I wanted to be a theater actor.

72
00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:12.793
(They have the spur-of-the-moment talk show while waiting.)

73
00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:17.932
("My Unexpected Life")

74
00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:20.603
Then did you act in theater before?

75
00:03:20.603 --> 00:03:21.633
Yes.

76
00:03:22.163 --> 00:03:23.672
I joined the troupe to become an actor.

77
00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:26.432
At that time, we weren't supposed to speak with a dialect.

78
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.302
The intonation wasn't supposed to be different from the standard too.

79
00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.642
So that's why...

80
00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:33.473
(A guy from Busan was experiencing the limit of roles he could play.)

81
00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:36.283
I joined the comedy circle rather coincidentally.

82
00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:39.913
I partook in the Comedian Contest in my junior year of college.

83
00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:41.952
- My friends encouraged me. - They did?

84
00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:43.723
- They knew you were talented? - Yes.

85
00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:45.193
What was the skit you did for the contest?

86
00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:51.732
I can't talk about it because it's been so long.

87
00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:53.093
Come on. We're just talking here.

88
00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:54.962
You're not going to act out the skit anyway.

89
00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:58.033
- Don't ask me to do the skit. - Pardon?

90
00:03:58.403 --> 00:03:59.503
- I won't. - If you ask me to do the skit...

91
00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:01.843
- I wouldn't dare to ask you. - Exactly.

92
00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:02.903
What was it?

93
00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.473
I spoke broken Chinese.

94
00:04:04.473 --> 00:04:06.672
- Broken Chinese? - Yes.

95
00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:08.982
I would make no sense while speaking Chinese.

96
00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.353
- So did you pass? - Yes.

97
00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:12.982
- Only eight of us were chosen. - You made the cut.

98
00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:14.682
At that time...

99
00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:17.422
How much was it? I think I received about 35 dollars.

100
00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:19.322
- Come again? - 35 dollars.

101
00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:22.422
- I won 35 dollars 30 years ago. - 35 dollars?

102
00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.293
Is that a lot compared to the value nowadays?

103
00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:26.432
How much was a bowl of jjajangmyeon at that time?

104
00:04:26.963 --> 00:04:29.163
- It was 50 cents. - My gosh, then it was a lot.

105
00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:30.163
It cost 50 cents then.

106
00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:31.833
Right now, it's six dollars.

107
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:32.973
That's right.

108
00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:35.403
Did you know how to speak Chinese? Or did you just say anything?

109
00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:36.973
I did it for fun.

110
00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:39.612
Don't dig too deep into this.

111
00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.682
I'm just curious how it sounds like.

112
00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.913
- Didn't I tell you? - I'm curious how it sounds.

113
00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:44.013
Don't even ask me that.

114
00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:45.052
I learned Chinese.

115
00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:46.312
- No, no. - Hello.

116
00:04:46.312 --> 00:04:47.882
"Hello"...

117
00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:50.752
- I didn't use that kind of phrases. - Then what did you say?

118
00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:53.023
I narrated for Chinese movies.

119
00:04:53.023 --> 00:04:54.093
- You did the narration? - Yes.

120
00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.362
But you still did a skit that was related to films back then.

121
00:04:57.362 --> 00:05:01.603
I did a fake narration for a Chinese film.

122
00:05:02.932 --> 00:05:04.273
(If so...)

123
00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:06.033
Why don't you show me...

124
00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:07.672
Stop it.

125
00:05:07.672 --> 00:05:09.773
I'm just curious how it sounds.

126
00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:13.013
When you watch Chinese films, they begin with narrations.

127
00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:14.083
Like how?

128
00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:17.213
It went something like that.

129
00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:18.482
- Just like that? - Yes.

130
00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:20.783
- You were 1 of the 8 finalists? - Yes.

131
00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:22.122
I did it for three minutes.

132
00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.122
- Three minutes? - But I did kung fu together.

133
00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:26.293
- You did kung fu too? - Yes, I did it with kung fu.

134
00:05:27.023 --> 00:05:28.463
How did you do kung fu?

135
00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.833
- I did kung fu, you know? - Yes.

136
00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:35.932
I became a comedian for speaking broken Chinese.

137
00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.773
Back in the days, Chinese films were really popular.

138
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:41.072
- Hong Kong films. Crime dramas. - Yes, precisely.

139
00:05:41.072 --> 00:05:42.442
So who was that? Jackie Chan.

140
00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:43.672
Jackie Chan. Jet Li.

141
00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:46.242
Yes, Jet Li was one of them. When he came to Korea,

142
00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:47.742
he and I filmed a show together.

143
00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:50.353
We filmed "Sunday Night" which is still airing until this day.

144
00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:53.213
- "Sunday Night"? - I played Huang Feihong.

145
00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.252
Did you wear the traditional Chinese clothes back then?

146
00:05:55.252 --> 00:05:59.052
At that time, I wore the bald wig cap for Huang Feihong.

147
00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:00.893
Gyeong Gyu.

148
00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:03.463
(At that time, he owned every skit with Chinese influence.)

149
00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.663
What is it?

150
00:06:05.593 --> 00:06:07.703
Even Andy Lau starred on the show.

151
00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:10.572
(His broken Chinese sounded like a native's.)

152
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.403
(The talk of his spirit)

153
00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.372
There was a Chinese actress.

154
00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:16.072
- Was she famous? Who was it? - Yes.

155
00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:18.372
Her name was Brigitte Lin of "Swordsman II".

156
00:06:18.372 --> 00:06:19.713
I know the film.

157
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.583
I also worked with her on a show once.

158
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:23.853
(Gyeong Gyu worked with famous Chinese actors and actresses.)

159
00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:27.083
- Did you talk to them in Chinese? - At that time...

160
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:28.322
- I was faking it. - How...

161
00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:30.153
What about your special eye skill?

162
00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:32.793
I did that when I made my debut.

163
00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:34.692
I did when I debuted.

164
00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:37.062
- That's when you did it? - Yes, it was during my debut.

165
00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:38.333
The one that went like this?

166
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.862
(He might have to roll his eyes.)

167
00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:43.263
Then you were chosen in an audition, right?

168
00:06:43.263 --> 00:06:44.403
- Me? - Yes.

169
00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:47.442
Actually, I became a singer unconventionally.

170
00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:50.413
I didn't pass any auditions, so I was working at a cafe.

171
00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:53.882
The manager of the cafe asked his friend to introduce me...

172
00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.382
to some people in the entertainment business...

173
00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:57.853
because the manager knew I always went for auditions.

174
00:06:57.853 --> 00:07:01.182
His friend asked me who my favorite singers were.

175
00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:02.922
I said that I liked Nell.

176
00:07:03.793 --> 00:07:06.653
And his friend told me that he was the agent for Nell.

177
00:07:06.853 --> 00:07:09.763
At that time, he was a director although he's not anymore.

178
00:07:10.192 --> 00:07:12.593
He asked me if I wanted to do an audition,

179
00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.163
so I did have the audition.

180
00:07:15.132 --> 00:07:16.163
Then I passed it.

181
00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:18.732
What did you sing in your audition?

182
00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:22.072
There's a song called "Yearning" by Nell.

183
00:07:22.172 --> 00:07:23.502
The lyrics go like this.

184
00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:26.572
(He starts singing right away.)

185
00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:29.083
(It's a common thing to say, but I want to go back)

186
00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:34.182
(His mellow voice flows right away without any hesitation.)

187
00:07:35.252 --> 00:07:39.453
(He was going to make Sung Kyu fluster by asking him to sing.)

188
00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:45.293
(This beautiful song went against his prediction.)

189
00:07:45.992 --> 00:07:48.263
Only after I lost you

190
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.973
The song went like this. It's been a while since I sung it.

191
00:07:51.973 --> 00:07:54.343
So when I was singing the song,

192
00:07:54.502 --> 00:07:57.072
I thought I should sing an English song too.

193
00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.043
- I had to pretend to be classy. - That's right.

194
00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:00.343
That's true. You ought to.

195
00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:02.213
I couldn't even sing English songs well,

196
00:08:02.213 --> 00:08:04.013
but I sang a female singer's song after switching the key.

197
00:08:04.013 --> 00:08:06.552
There's a song called "Love" by Keyshia Cole.

198
00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:09.523
What was it?

199
00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:12.622
It was like this.

200
00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:14.562
(My gosh)

201
00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.862
(Lilting)

202
00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:20.093
I did a lot of tricks while singing it.

203
00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:21.802
I pretended that the song was difficult to pull off.

204
00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:24.703
(Sung Kyu already won over Gyeong Gyu's heart.)

205
00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:27.802
I kept singing the song until they would have me.

206
00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:30.043
(Singing)

207
00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:33.413
When I sang like this, they seemed impressed.

208
00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:35.913
They asked me to sing one more.

209
00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:37.212
So I kept on singing.

210
00:08:37.212 --> 00:08:39.952
Then the interviewers said it was enough.

211
00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:42.523
I was asked if I knew how to dance.

212
00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:45.452
So I told them that I loved dancing ever since I was a kid.

213
00:08:46.523 --> 00:08:47.763
Aren't you a bad dancer though?

214
00:08:47.763 --> 00:08:49.692
Yes, I am. I have poor physical coordination.

215
00:08:49.692 --> 00:08:50.692
I knew it.

216
00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:52.633
Actually, I get scared easily.

217
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.663
I'm not a great dancer,

218
00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:59.572
but I practiced dancing every single day as if my life depended on it.

219
00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:00.802
(He had a strong will back then.)

220
00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:05.312
(Now, the master chef of chicken is living with him.)

221
00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:07.143
Doesn't it smell different?

222
00:09:08.513 --> 00:09:10.182
Doesn't it? Right?

223
00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.283
Right.

224
00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:13.452
- It smells different. - I see.

225
00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.582
So this chicken is...

226
00:09:15.582 --> 00:09:17.552
way bigger than other chickens.

227
00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:19.422
- What? Of course. - This one is bigger.

228
00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:22.263
This is no match. This is a whole new kind of chicken.

229
00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:24.233
(Spring onions to remove bad smells)

230
00:09:24.233 --> 00:09:26.062
I'm trying to get rid of bad smells from the chicken.

231
00:09:26.062 --> 00:09:27.733
- With spring onions? - So I'm adding spring onions.

232
00:09:28.562 --> 00:09:30.503
Should we put more? Or is it enough?

233
00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.903
This is good. If you put a lot, it gets spicy.

234
00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:37.043
(The chicken baeksuk is finished!)

235
00:09:37.572 --> 00:09:40.682
(Gyeong Gyu cuts the chicken apart.)

236
00:09:41.483 --> 00:09:44.413
(He takes apart a big drumstick.)

237
00:09:44.413 --> 00:09:45.682
Gosh, it's hot.

238
00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:48.552
(He gives it to Sung Kyu first.)

239
00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:52.722
(Sung Kyu is moved by the way he takes care of him first.)

240
00:09:53.523 --> 00:09:56.793
(He gives a lot of soup as well.)

241
00:09:57.993 --> 00:09:59.133
Here's an abalone.

242
00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.233
(He places the abalone as its topping.)

243
00:10:01.932 --> 00:10:05.102
- Let's eat. Dig in. - Thank you for cooking.

244
00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:08.003
Season it with salt.

245
00:10:08.572 --> 00:10:10.072
My gosh, it really hits the spot.

246
00:10:10.072 --> 00:10:11.342
(He mixes the salt just like Gyeong Gyu did.)

247
00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:16.942
I guess they want to eat this.

248
00:10:17.812 --> 00:10:20.552
(I really like chicken baeksuk too.)

249
00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:24.352
(Gyeong Gyu is too busy enjoying the soup regardless of his dog.)

250
00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:27.263
My gosh, it really hits the spot.

251
00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:28.692
(He's impressed with his own cooking.)

252
00:10:28.692 --> 00:10:31.163
My goodness, Sung Kyu. Hey.

253
00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:35.602
(Let me try it too.)

254
00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.873
I like the soup.

255
00:10:37.873 --> 00:10:38.873
(The soup is okay.)

256
00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:41.302
(They try it again.)

257
00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:42.373
Isn't it nice?

258
00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:45.273
When I only had the soup,

259
00:10:46.472 --> 00:10:48.383
it tasted like the ordinary baeksuk.

260
00:10:49.243 --> 00:10:50.383
No. No.

261
00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:51.483
- No? - No.

262
00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:53.852
- Is it different? - It's different.

263
00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:55.452
Try the meat.

264
00:10:55.682 --> 00:10:57.153
- The meat must be different. - It is different.

265
00:10:57.153 --> 00:10:58.393
(It's chicken farmed in Gangwon Province.)

266
00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:00.363
(He's excited.)

267
00:11:01.793 --> 00:11:03.832
(What?)

268
00:11:03.832 --> 00:11:04.962
Is it cooked?

269
00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:06.033
It's cooked.

270
00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.462
The meat is a little red.

271
00:11:11.102 --> 00:11:12.903
(He tries everything...)

272
00:11:12.903 --> 00:11:14.442
(to take the meat off the bone.)

273
00:11:15.143 --> 00:11:17.172
I am not joking. It's really not coming off.

274
00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:21.082
(It's very chewy.)

275
00:11:22.342 --> 00:11:24.413
(There's no way.)

276
00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:25.552
It's all cooked.

277
00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:28.253
(It looks fine on the outside.)

278
00:11:29.253 --> 00:11:31.822
(It is...)

279
00:11:31.822 --> 00:11:32.993
(cooked!)

280
00:11:36.123 --> 00:11:37.993
(It's not cooked, is it?)

281
00:11:38.993 --> 00:11:40.062
(Of course it's cooked!)

282
00:11:40.062 --> 00:11:41.533
Are you okay?

283
00:11:42.332 --> 00:11:44.172
(It is cooked!)

284
00:11:44.172 --> 00:11:46.403
Wait. Perhaps we will get food poisoning?

285
00:11:48.243 --> 00:11:50.812
(To get rid of his suspicion, )

286
00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:54.383
(Gyeong Gyu fights with slightly uncooked chicken.)

287
00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:58.783
(He dismantles the leg.)

288
00:12:00.483 --> 00:12:02.753
(At that rate, )

289
00:12:02.753 --> 00:12:04.192
(he's going to lose all his teeth.)

290
00:12:04.852 --> 00:12:07.623
(He struggles to chew.)

291
00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:09.592
Are you all right?

292
00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:11.462
(He's dizzy.)

293
00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:13.832
I am not joking.

294
00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:15.763
Why is it so tough?

295
00:12:15.962 --> 00:12:17.972
It's very tough. I think it's not cooked.

296
00:12:19.903 --> 00:12:21.503
- It's too tough. - Is it?

297
00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:25.043
It's like chewing rubber.

298
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.212
(He said it's like rubber.)

299
00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.613
I am not joking. It's really like chewing rubber.

300
00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:32.653
What happened?

301
00:12:34.322 --> 00:12:35.352
It's cooked.

302
00:12:36.253 --> 00:12:39.452
(It looks cooked to only Gyeong Gyu.)

303
00:12:40.462 --> 00:12:43.092
I drove three hours to buy this.

304
00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:46.293
It's still red. You shouldn't eat it.

305
00:12:46.962 --> 00:12:48.233
(Is it still red?)

306
00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:50.672
Then let's boil it one more time.

307
00:12:50.672 --> 00:12:53.702
(He pretends to be cool.)

308
00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.302
Let's put it back.

309
00:12:55.302 --> 00:12:56.672
It's just for the two of us anyway.

310
00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:57.812
(They end up...)

311
00:12:57.812 --> 00:12:59.972
(putting back the legs.)

312
00:12:59.972 --> 00:13:01.442
- Is it not cooked? - It's not cooked at all.

313
00:13:02.143 --> 00:13:03.413
I ate almost everything.

314
00:13:04.613 --> 00:13:06.712
It's okay even if it's not cooked.

315
00:13:08.123 --> 00:13:09.422
Some people eat it raw.

316
00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.192
(They boil it again.)

317
00:13:11.822 --> 00:13:14.493
(Since we're boiling it again...)

318
00:13:14.763 --> 00:13:16.092
Should we put some more spring onions?

319
00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:18.133
Okay. I will put them in.

320
00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.503
(Sung Kyu becomes busy.)

321
00:13:20.503 --> 00:13:21.533
It's delicious.

322
00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:24.972
(Gyeong Gyu is enjoying his meal.)

323
00:13:27.643 --> 00:13:29.672
(He adds green onions cut with scissors.)

324
00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:32.442
(He looks at Gyeong Gyu.)

325
00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:35.342
It's nice though.

326
00:13:35.342 --> 00:13:37.113
(Their positions have been changed.)

327
00:13:38.552 --> 00:13:40.182
(I thought you were going to do everything.)

328
00:13:40.682 --> 00:13:42.123
Don't put too much spring onions.

329
00:13:42.123 --> 00:13:43.952
Okay. I will put this much.

330
00:13:45.123 --> 00:13:47.062
- Should we put some more water? - Yes. I will put more water.

331
00:13:47.062 --> 00:13:48.123
(It means Sung Kyu should bring water.)

332
00:13:48.993 --> 00:13:50.663
I think we need to cook it for two hours.

333
00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.432
- No. No. - At least an hour.

334
00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:53.962
That's not necessary.

335
00:13:55.863 --> 00:13:56.903
The lady said...

336
00:13:57.972 --> 00:13:59.302
I should cook it for 20 minutes.

337
00:13:59.302 --> 00:14:01.273
I think that's if we're using a pressure cooker.

338
00:14:02.143 --> 00:14:04.072
- I don't think so. - We had to use that.

339
00:14:04.672 --> 00:14:06.942
(When he was getting the recipe from Gangwon Province, )

340
00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:08.842
(he only remembered the 20-minute part.)

341
00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:10.913
(She said he should cook it in a pressure cooker.)

342
00:14:10.913 --> 00:14:12.582
- You cook it in a pressure cooker. - Garlic and...

343
00:14:12.582 --> 00:14:14.483
But we cooked it in a normal pot.

344
00:14:16.052 --> 00:14:19.023
(He made a fatal mistake.)

345
00:14:19.552 --> 00:14:20.863
- Wait. - Wait.

346
00:14:21.092 --> 00:14:23.363
When you bit into the meat,

347
00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:24.692
it didn't taste like what you had...

348
00:14:24.692 --> 00:14:25.763
- at the fishery, did it? - No.

349
00:14:25.893 --> 00:14:27.332
(He admits it fast.)

350
00:14:27.903 --> 00:14:29.462
(He suddenly confesses.)

351
00:14:29.863 --> 00:14:31.832
It shocked me. I am sorry.

352
00:14:31.832 --> 00:14:34.373
(It's all my fault.)

353
00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.143
(He laughs out loud.)

354
00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:37.312
I am sweating.

355
00:14:37.312 --> 00:14:39.873
It really surprised me. The meat was like rubber.

356
00:14:39.873 --> 00:14:40.913
- Right? - Yes.

357
00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.143
I thought I was going to lose my teeth.

358
00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:43.312
My gosh.

359
00:14:43.312 --> 00:14:44.513
It was still red.

360
00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:45.913
It surprised me.

361
00:14:45.913 --> 00:14:46.983
(Thank goodness they cooked it again.)

362
00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:48.582
Wasn't it still good though?

363
00:14:49.182 --> 00:14:50.222
Wasn't it good?

364
00:14:50.922 --> 00:14:51.952
Let's eat it again.

365
00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:55.722
It's not good if you take a break and eat it again.

366
00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:59.233
(He sighs.)

367
00:15:00.092 --> 00:15:01.763
- What's this noise? - We nearly died.

368
00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:03.202
What's this?

369
00:15:03.363 --> 00:15:06.373
(30 minutes later)

370
00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:07.602
Should we open it?

371
00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:08.873
(They check the baeksuk.)

372
00:15:10.373 --> 00:15:12.273
(It's boiling hard.)

373
00:15:14.082 --> 00:15:15.143
Wasn't it like that?

374
00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:17.113
It wasn't even boiling a while ago.

375
00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:18.513
- Was it not bubbling? - No.

376
00:15:20.113 --> 00:15:22.123
- It's much softer now. - Is it?

377
00:15:22.123 --> 00:15:23.222
(Thankfully, it's well-cooked.)

378
00:15:23.623 --> 00:15:25.653
Should we taste it now?

379
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.092
Let's try it.

380
00:15:29.123 --> 00:15:30.462
(He's very excited.)

381
00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:32.062
It looks amazing.

382
00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:34.432
- The broth became richer. - Yes.

383
00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:35.763
This is yours, right?

384
00:15:35.763 --> 00:15:37.233
(They look for their legs.)

385
00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:40.033
Mine is the one barely eaten. This is yours. You ate a lot.

386
00:15:40.743 --> 00:15:42.543
(He gives Gyeong Gyu his leg.)

387
00:15:44.413 --> 00:15:46.373
(Where is my leg?)

388
00:15:48.243 --> 00:15:49.312
Where is yours?

389
00:15:50.013 --> 00:15:51.383
It's here.

390
00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:52.712
(However...)

391
00:15:53.013 --> 00:15:54.052
Is this not mine?

392
00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:56.253
(It's very thin.)

393
00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.153
Wait.

394
00:15:59.153 --> 00:16:00.322
You finished it.

395
00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.592
(Sung Kyu nearly lost his chance of tasting the meat.)

396
00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:07.462
How did I eat almost all the meat?

397
00:16:07.462 --> 00:16:09.102
You ate all the meat.

398
00:16:11.633 --> 00:16:12.633
(He pokes it.)

399
00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:14.403
Right. It's cooked now.

400
00:16:14.972 --> 00:16:16.773
The meat is soft now.

401
00:16:16.773 --> 00:16:17.812
(It's well-cooked.)

402
00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:21.383
(Gyeong Gyu's baeksuk is finally cooked.)

403
00:16:21.383 --> 00:16:23.243
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

404
00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:26.483
(They resume their dinner.)

405
00:16:26.483 --> 00:16:27.623
Let's try it.

406
00:16:27.922 --> 00:16:29.623
(He slurps the soup.)

407
00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:30.922
The soup is nice now.

408
00:16:30.922 --> 00:16:32.222
This is good.

409
00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:34.793
(Gyeong Gyu is satisfied too.)

410
00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.033
Eat this part.

411
00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:38.432
(Gyeong Gyu takes care of Sung Kyu.)

412
00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:40.432
(Sung Kyu enjoys it this time.)

413
00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:42.302
(It's delicious.)

414
00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:45.332
(Gyeong Gyu cuts the meat for Sung Kyu.)

415
00:16:45.332 --> 00:16:47.072
You need to try the meat as well.

416
00:16:47.342 --> 00:16:49.102
- I don't have much experience. - That's why.

417
00:16:49.102 --> 00:16:50.472
So I don't know the taste well.

418
00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:52.043
Now you can eat it.

419
00:16:54.082 --> 00:16:55.682
Dip it in the salt and try it.

420
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.013
(Come on.)

421
00:16:57.013 --> 00:16:59.082
You have to say it's delicious.

422
00:17:00.013 --> 00:17:01.023
Try it.

423
00:17:01.023 --> 00:17:02.352
(He's thirsty for reaction.)

424
00:17:02.352 --> 00:17:04.192
Is it good or bad? Taste it.

425
00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:05.793
How is it?

426
00:17:05.793 --> 00:17:07.923
(He reacts like a robot.)

427
00:17:08.662 --> 00:17:10.592
(That's it.)

428
00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:11.592
It's good, isn't it?

429
00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:12.662
This chicken is...

430
00:17:12.662 --> 00:17:13.832
(He's pretending to like the baeksuk.)

431
00:17:14.832 --> 00:17:16.632
This is how it's supposed to taste.

432
00:17:16.632 --> 00:17:17.632
(It's hard to react.)

433
00:17:18.773 --> 00:17:19.872
(He eats loudly.)

434
00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.003
It's delicious.

435
00:17:21.203 --> 00:17:23.102
(This is the perfect example of how you should react.)

436
00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:25.112
- Do you want some more? - No.

437
00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:26.872
(He eats well.)

438
00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:29.842
You should eat more. You don't have much meat.

439
00:17:29.912 --> 00:17:30.953
I will give you my leg.

440
00:17:30.953 --> 00:17:32.052
(Sung Kyu tries to give meat to Gyeong Gyu.)

441
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.112
It's fine.

442
00:17:34.122 --> 00:17:35.122
It's all right.

443
00:17:35.283 --> 00:17:38.023
(But it's really okay.)

444
00:17:39.322 --> 00:17:41.392
(Have some more.)

445
00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.562
Eat some rice too.

446
00:17:45.493 --> 00:17:46.963
(He puts rice in the soup.)

447
00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:49.433
It's nice.

448
00:17:49.433 --> 00:17:50.572
(He's quiet.)

449
00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.433
Say something.

450
00:17:53.802 --> 00:17:54.902
It's good.

451
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:57.443
It's good.

452
00:17:58.213 --> 00:18:00.443
- When you eat as if it's good, - Yes.

453
00:18:00.443 --> 00:18:03.013
it will taste more delicious. You can't complain.

454
00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:06.082
(My goodness.)

455
00:18:07.082 --> 00:18:08.183
It's delicious.

456
00:18:09.852 --> 00:18:11.052
(Gyeong Gyu's acting makes Sung Kyu laugh.)

457
00:18:11.052 --> 00:18:12.923
(He can't stop laughing.)

458
00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.523
Next time, I will cook tteokguk for you.

459
00:18:17.632 --> 00:18:19.763
I am sorry. I'll go fishing...

460
00:18:19.763 --> 00:18:20.802
No. It's okay.

461
00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:23.362
- The soup is good. - Right.

462
00:18:25.473 --> 00:18:27.043
(We got what we want.)

463
00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:28.902
Let's stop eating.

464
00:18:28.902 --> 00:18:33.572
(He speaks his mind.)

465
00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:36.213
(Sung Kyu didn't see it coming.)

466
00:18:36.213 --> 00:18:37.213
Let's stop eating.

467
00:18:37.412 --> 00:18:39.052
It was really good.

468
00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:40.423
- Was it? - Thank you.

469
00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:42.822
- Yes. Give me another chance. - You did fine.

470
00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:44.193
- It's okay. - I will try one more time.

471
00:18:44.193 --> 00:18:45.523
I am okay.

472
00:18:45.693 --> 00:18:47.622
The fact that you cooked for me...

473
00:18:47.622 --> 00:18:49.723
When will I experience this in my life?

474
00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:51.162
You don't need to say anything.

475
00:18:51.892 --> 00:18:53.562
- I... - No.

476
00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.602
I was really touched today.

477
00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:56.763
(He tries hard not to let another tragedy happen.)

478
00:18:56.763 --> 00:18:57.802
It was really good.

479
00:18:58.102 --> 00:18:59.233
- Eat this mushroom. - Thank you.

480
00:19:01.142 --> 00:19:03.043
Your mom must be watching this, right?

481
00:19:03.043 --> 00:19:04.043
My mom?

482
00:19:04.412 --> 00:19:06.013
She must be really touched.

483
00:19:06.013 --> 00:19:07.983
She must've been touched that you got...

484
00:19:07.983 --> 00:19:10.683
the chicken for her son...

485
00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:12.953
and cooked it for him.

486
00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:14.852
She must be...

487
00:19:15.382 --> 00:19:17.023
thrilled and moved.

488
00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:18.023
(He says whatever he can think of.)

489
00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:20.793
We can stay in Jeonju for 2 nights and 3 days.

490
00:19:22.122 --> 00:19:23.193
Why would we?

491
00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:24.392
I want to visit your house.

492
00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:27.933
(I want to be your housemate again.)

493
00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:30.902
(Sung Kyu didn't know until then.)

494
00:19:32.433 --> 00:19:33.773
(He didn't know what result Gyeong Gyu's words would bring.)

495
00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:35.003
I will go to Jeonju one day.

496
00:19:35.902 --> 00:19:37.543
(It's an early morning...)

497
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:39.112
(at a train station.)

498
00:19:40.072 --> 00:19:42.882
(Here comes Gyeong Gyu.)

499
00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.122
(Is he not here yet?)

500
00:19:47.582 --> 00:19:49.683
(He looks around.)

501
00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:51.852
Sung Kyu.

502
00:19:51.993 --> 00:19:53.822
It's...

503
00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:56.562
I thought about what to do in Jeonju.

504
00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:57.592
(Their trip to Jeonju came about because of Gyeong Gyu's promise.)

505
00:19:57.892 --> 00:19:59.533
(With much anticipation, they leave for Jeonju.)

506
00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:02.203
(Wanna One comes to My Unexpected Housemate.)

507
00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:04.302
(The owner is sad because Wanna One is too popular.)

508
00:20:04.902 --> 00:20:06.872
(Ong Niel Hwan are excited to get a housemate.)

509
00:20:08.142 --> 00:20:09.503
(But it's difficult from the start.)

510
00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.642
(Do they need to push each other?)

511
00:20:11.642 --> 00:20:12.773
(It's not that.)

512
00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:17.052
(They crave for home-cooked meal.)

513
00:20:18.253 --> 00:20:20.523
(They are invited to the world of men.)

514
00:20:21.322 --> 00:20:23.552
(It's time to listen to Jeong Soo and Joong Wan's terms.)

515
00:20:24.753 --> 00:20:26.453
Why are there so many dishes?

516
00:20:27.523 --> 00:20:29.122
But they are cleaner than his back.

517
00:20:29.122 --> 00:20:30.263
(They play the ladder game.)

518
00:20:31.533 --> 00:20:33.763
(Who will wash the dishes that are cleaner than Jeong Soo's back?)

519
00:20:34.332 --> 00:20:37.533
(Daniel began the game.)

520
00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:38.602
Like this?

521
00:20:38.602 --> 00:20:40.173
(The result is...)

522
00:20:40.842 --> 00:20:42.402
(Daniel has to wash the dishes.)

523
00:20:42.402 --> 00:20:43.602
They all passed.

524
00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:46.043
(It's Jae Hwan's turn.)

525
00:20:46.543 --> 00:20:47.783
(Screaming)

526
00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:49.642
(He has to...)

527
00:20:49.642 --> 00:20:50.953
(scrub Jeong Soo's back.)

528
00:20:51.312 --> 00:20:54.152
Seong Woo! Seong Woo!

529
00:20:54.382 --> 00:20:56.352
I knew this would happen.

530
00:20:57.552 --> 00:20:59.223
- Isn't this better than scrubbing? - Yes.

531
00:20:59.892 --> 00:21:01.793
(They're happy that they don't have to scrub Jeong Soo's back.)

532
00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:03.592
- Right. - This is better than scrubbing.

533
00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:07.662
(Jeong Soo's soaking his body.)

534
00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:09.062
(It's good.)

535
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.572
- I don't even scrub my dad's back. - Right.

536
00:21:12.102 --> 00:21:13.302
I never had a chance to.

537
00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:15.503
Where did you live in Busan?

538
00:21:15.503 --> 00:21:16.842
Youngdo, Busan.

539
00:21:17.013 --> 00:21:18.673
- What? Youngdo? - Yes.

540
00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.412
- You have a successful life now. - I have.

541
00:21:21.412 --> 00:21:23.082
- I'm from Gamcheon. - In Youngdo...

542
00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.253
- Really? - Do you know Gamcheon?

543
00:21:25.082 --> 00:21:26.152
Of course I do.

544
00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.052
He's in the water to scrub his body.

545
00:21:30.283 --> 00:21:33.352
What if he gets really big from soaking himself?

546
00:21:33.622 --> 00:21:35.362
Like Captain America.

547
00:21:37.132 --> 00:21:40.733
(He's transforming into Captain America.)

548
00:21:41.332 --> 00:21:43.533
It's so funny that this is better than back scrubbing.

549
00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:44.872
It's much better than that.

550
00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:46.072
(They're glad that they get to wash the dishes.)

551
00:21:46.072 --> 00:21:47.842
It's better than scrubbing.

552
00:21:48.802 --> 00:21:51.773
(These two are enjoying washing the dishes.)

553
00:21:52.543 --> 00:21:54.082
(He's tidy.)

554
00:21:54.912 --> 00:21:57.983
(Kitchen is getting cleaned up.)

555
00:21:58.783 --> 00:21:59.983
He's sound asleep.

556
00:22:01.923 --> 00:22:03.253
Jae Hwan.

557
00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:06.322
We have to wake him up.

558
00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:08.662
- Seong Woo. - I should wake him up.

559
00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:12.062
Seong Woo. Seong Woo.

560
00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:14.463
Jae Hwan. Jae Hwan.

561
00:22:15.132 --> 00:22:16.832
- You have to scrub his back now. - Okay.

562
00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:18.733
Is he soaked?

563
00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:20.642
Jae Hwan.

564
00:22:21.443 --> 00:22:22.673
Yes. I'm coming.

565
00:22:22.673 --> 00:22:23.673
(He rushes.)

566
00:22:23.943 --> 00:22:25.773
- This is crazy. - It's hilarious.

567
00:22:26.713 --> 00:22:29.312
- Your face is so red. - Really?

568
00:22:29.312 --> 00:22:31.253
- Yes. Your face is so red. - It's so hot.

569
00:22:31.513 --> 00:22:34.253
I should get soaked since you're going to scrub my back.

570
00:22:34.253 --> 00:22:36.223
I feel dizzy, but I'm enduring it.

571
00:22:37.892 --> 00:22:39.253
(He gets up.)

572
00:22:39.753 --> 00:22:41.662
This will make your life easier.

573
00:22:43.832 --> 00:22:45.493
- Now... - Is the position good?

574
00:22:45.592 --> 00:22:46.862
- It's good. - It's good.

575
00:22:48.632 --> 00:22:50.473
Oh, cold. Dip it in hot water.

576
00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:51.473
That's so cold.

577
00:22:51.473 --> 00:22:53.003
Dip it in hot water. That's so cold.

578
00:22:54.342 --> 00:22:57.342
- Are they washing the dishes? - Yes. I think they're almost done.

579
00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:59.072
Are you scrubbing? Why is it so small?

580
00:22:59.173 --> 00:23:01.243
I can't believe Wanna One's scrubbing my back.

581
00:23:01.543 --> 00:23:03.483
It's good...

582
00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:05.852
Say it's good to keep a good relationship, okay?

583
00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:06.852
(What a scene to watch.)

584
00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:09.523
It looks like they're scrubbing a toad's back.

585
00:23:09.523 --> 00:23:10.892
It looks like you're scrubbing a toad's back.

586
00:23:10.892 --> 00:23:12.223
It's so nice.

587
00:23:12.993 --> 00:23:14.223
It's so nice.

588
00:23:14.463 --> 00:23:15.993
- It's awesome. - I see dead skin.

589
00:23:15.993 --> 00:23:17.162
- Do you? - Yes.

590
00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:18.392
Hey. Dead skin is coming off.

591
00:23:18.733 --> 00:23:21.302
(Jeong Soo's dead skin's coming off.)

592
00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:25.072
It's so memorable that you're scrubbing me.

593
00:23:26.433 --> 00:23:29.342
(Jeong Soo's living condition was to scrub his back.)

594
00:23:30.072 --> 00:23:31.543
(Seong Woo and Jae Hwan...)

595
00:23:32.372 --> 00:23:33.983
(enthusiastically scrubbed...)

596
00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.352
(the single man, Jeong Soo's itchy back.)

597
00:23:37.882 --> 00:23:39.253
Is it done? Did you get a lot?

598
00:23:39.253 --> 00:23:40.253
- I think this is enough. - Yes.

599
00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:42.753
- Is it enough? Is there a lot? - Yes.

600
00:23:42.983 --> 00:23:44.352
Do we get to leave...

601
00:23:45.322 --> 00:23:46.652
at dinner time?

602
00:23:47.763 --> 00:23:48.963
Come on.

603
00:23:49.662 --> 00:23:50.993
- Thank you. - Okay.

604
00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:52.392
- All right. - Okay.

605
00:23:52.493 --> 00:23:54.632
I didn't expect to see dead skin for real.

606
00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:56.763
We got dead skin for real.

607
00:23:57.033 --> 00:23:58.433
I really fell asleep before.

608
00:23:58.572 --> 00:24:00.273
I even had a dream for a second.

609
00:24:01.943 --> 00:24:03.572
(Grunting)

610
00:24:04.572 --> 00:24:05.872
(He's acting cute.)

611
00:24:06.713 --> 00:24:07.983
(Grunting)

612
00:24:09.082 --> 00:24:11.112
(Three people are lying down side by side.)

613
00:24:12.183 --> 00:24:15.523
(They must've been very tired.)

614
00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:17.852
(They fell asleep as soon as they lied down.)

615
00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:22.993
(Landlord Jeong Soo gets ready to go out.)

616
00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:25.632
(They planned to go outside together.)

617
00:24:26.433 --> 00:24:28.302
(Joong Wan comes out of his room after taking a break.)

618
00:24:28.302 --> 00:24:29.963
(They're sleeping so deeply.)

619
00:24:29.963 --> 00:24:31.102
How should I wake them up?

620
00:24:31.933 --> 00:24:33.902
(A large speaker is here.)

621
00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:37.043
(What's he going to do with the speaker?)

622
00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.412
Is it playing? Is it playing?

623
00:24:42.243 --> 00:24:44.852
(A special wake up call)

624
00:24:44.852 --> 00:24:45.983
(He's surprised.)

625
00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:49.253
(He responds to the song instantly.)

626
00:24:50.352 --> 00:24:51.493
He's not getting up.

627
00:24:51.493 --> 00:24:53.193
(Jae Hwan's up, but not Daniel.)

628
00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:54.293
Turn it louder.

629
00:24:55.923 --> 00:25:00.062
(Not even this loud sound wakes him up.)

630
00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:02.402
(He doesn't even move.)

631
00:25:03.203 --> 00:25:07.543
(Even in screaming and dancing...)

632
00:25:08.743 --> 00:25:12.473
(Even in a fierce support, )

633
00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:14.582
(Daniel's world is silent.)

634
00:25:15.912 --> 00:25:18.483
(He surely is a king of sleep.)

635
00:25:19.582 --> 00:25:20.683
Wait.

636
00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:24.253
(The props are upgraded.)

637
00:25:25.122 --> 00:25:28.293
(I'm the hero of tonight)

638
00:25:28.763 --> 00:25:30.223
Wake up.

639
00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:35.332
(He moves along the rhythm as soon as he wakes up.)

640
00:25:37.673 --> 00:25:40.943
(Dancing)

641
00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:45.342
(He dances perfectly even though he's half asleep.)

642
00:25:45.396 --> 00:25:49.796
<font color="#F1E6B2">[VIU Ver] E26 Outrageous Roommates</font>

644
00:25:52.112 --> 00:25:53.253
That was amazing.

645
00:25:53.253 --> 00:25:54.683
(Waking up was like a war.)

646
00:25:55.423 --> 00:25:57.322
(I had a good sleep.)

647
00:25:57.352 --> 00:25:59.253
- Are you okay? - Do you want to go shopping?

648
00:25:59.293 --> 00:26:00.622
- Yes. - Yes.

649
00:26:00.862 --> 00:26:02.062
How about we go shopping?

650
00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:03.733
That's about spending money.

651
00:26:03.733 --> 00:26:05.392
Lately, I'm got interested in fashion.

652
00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:06.493
- Who is? - Me.

653
00:26:07.062 --> 00:26:08.933
I'm concerned with my look lately...

654
00:26:08.933 --> 00:26:10.933
because I saw Jang Chen.

655
00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:12.372
He was so hot.

656
00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:16.072
I bought few clothes in his style.

657
00:26:16.973 --> 00:26:18.513
Where are you going for shopping?

658
00:26:18.572 --> 00:26:19.713
Mangwon-dong.

659
00:26:20.043 --> 00:26:21.412
Oh, Mangwon-dong.

660
00:26:21.543 --> 00:26:23.612
- Let's go. - Give me 10 dollars.

661
00:26:23.612 --> 00:26:24.652
(Give me 10 dollars.)

662
00:26:24.652 --> 00:26:25.713
Let's go. I'm sorry.

663
00:26:25.953 --> 00:26:28.683
(The trio are in their room.)

664
00:26:28.683 --> 00:26:29.753
Let me wear socks.

665
00:26:30.122 --> 00:26:31.193
It's so dry.

666
00:26:31.793 --> 00:26:33.293
(Rolling)

667
00:26:33.453 --> 00:26:34.923
- Did you bring a lip balm? - Yes.

668
00:26:34.923 --> 00:26:35.993
I brought one too.

669
00:26:37.533 --> 00:26:38.592
I want to apply it too.

670
00:26:38.832 --> 00:26:41.332
My lips get dry so fast because it's winter.

671
00:26:41.562 --> 00:26:44.273
(My lips are precious.)

672
00:26:44.933 --> 00:26:46.473
- It smells good. - I know.

673
00:26:46.872 --> 00:26:48.443
- Let's go. - Let's go.

674
00:26:48.443 --> 00:26:50.872
- We're going out. - Let's go.

675
00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:54.943
I'll recommend a fashion style for Seong Woo,

676
00:26:55.243 --> 00:26:57.453
Jae Hwan, and Daniel.

677
00:26:57.453 --> 00:26:58.953
Guide Yook is great.

678
00:26:59.183 --> 00:27:00.953
- "Guide Yook." - "Guide Yook."

679
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.322
- 6 guides. - 6 guides.

680
00:27:02.423 --> 00:27:03.993
- I bought it at a cheap price. - It looks nice already.

681
00:27:03.993 --> 00:27:05.223
They have nice clothes.

682
00:27:06.052 --> 00:27:07.322
(It looks vintage from the entrance.)

683
00:27:07.322 --> 00:27:08.523
It's vintage.

684
00:27:08.523 --> 00:27:10.223
- Vintage. - Vintage.

685
00:27:10.632 --> 00:27:12.592
Everything's so unique.

686
00:27:12.592 --> 00:27:14.703
- Tell me about it. - This is awesome.

687
00:27:15.463 --> 00:27:17.273
Look around and tell me if you find anything you like.

688
00:27:17.273 --> 00:27:18.733
- I'll be the judge. - Okay.

689
00:27:18.832 --> 00:27:20.543
There are so many nice clothes.

690
00:27:21.302 --> 00:27:22.703
(Shopping after a long time...)

691
00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:24.013
This is nice.

692
00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:25.812
The jacket's really nice.

693
00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:28.483
I like this one.

694
00:27:28.582 --> 00:27:29.683
It's unique.

695
00:27:29.683 --> 00:27:31.183
(Daniel's the first one to pick one.)

696
00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:32.753
Sancho.

697
00:27:33.612 --> 00:27:35.652
Hey. That's nice.

698
00:27:35.882 --> 00:27:38.152
- It looks good on you. - Sancho.

699
00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:40.023
(Guide Yook's first evaluation)

700
00:27:40.023 --> 00:27:41.562
I want it. Let me try it on.

701
00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.562
You have a good taste of clothes.

702
00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:44.862
(He tries it on as he compliments.)

703
00:27:46.592 --> 00:27:47.832
Sancho.

704
00:27:48.763 --> 00:27:50.162
(Even though it's the same jacket, it looks very different.)

705
00:27:50.162 --> 00:27:51.332
Sancho.

706
00:27:51.933 --> 00:27:54.572
(Still, he can pull it off.)

707
00:27:55.543 --> 00:27:57.142
(It looks good on him.)

708
00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.612
Are you making fun of me?

709
00:27:59.713 --> 00:28:01.082
Are you making fun of me?

710
00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.513
- I like this one. - I do too.

711
00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:04.882
Would you like to try this on?

712
00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:06.713
Are you a fortune teller?

713
00:28:06.713 --> 00:28:08.122
What do you mean?

714
00:28:09.223 --> 00:28:10.723
(Let me try it on.)

715
00:28:11.622 --> 00:28:13.253
- You have a character. - What?

716
00:28:13.253 --> 00:28:15.392
- You have a character. - Where's the mirror?

717
00:28:16.162 --> 00:28:17.562
Oh, the hat.

718
00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:19.933
- I found a hat for this. - It's...

719
00:28:20.062 --> 00:28:21.832
- This one. - No.

720
00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.033
(Chuckling)

721
00:28:23.773 --> 00:28:25.602
(Do I have a character?)

722
00:28:25.973 --> 00:28:27.043
You remind me of her.

723
00:28:27.203 --> 00:28:28.943
The pigeon lady from "Home Alone".

724
00:28:29.043 --> 00:28:30.342
"Pigeon lady."

725
00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:31.973
(Find the difference.)

726
00:28:32.642 --> 00:28:34.612
Jae Hwan... I found one for Jae Hwan.

727
00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:38.483
Since you're cute, something like this suits you.

728
00:28:38.582 --> 00:28:39.953
- You think so? - Yes. Try it on.

729
00:28:39.953 --> 00:28:41.183
- Hurry up. Try it on. - Okay.

730
00:28:43.283 --> 00:28:44.592
Hey, Jae Hwan.

731
00:28:45.953 --> 00:28:48.723
- To look cuter, go like this. - Yes.

732
00:28:49.092 --> 00:28:50.223
Stand straight up.

733
00:28:50.223 --> 00:28:51.592
(Cute roll up and a long muffler that is about his height)

734
00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.763
(From his head to toe, it's all Guide Yook's work.)

735
00:28:53.763 --> 00:28:55.132
Don't doubt it.

736
00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:57.433
It's just not the style you're comfortable with.

737
00:28:57.433 --> 00:28:59.872
- Really? - Yes. Don't doubt it. It's perfect.

738
00:28:59.872 --> 00:29:01.102
- Really? - It's perfect.

739
00:29:01.602 --> 00:29:02.703
- Seong Woo. - Yes.

740
00:29:02.703 --> 00:29:03.743
Come here, Seong Woo.

741
00:29:03.743 --> 00:29:05.043
- Wouldn't it look great on you? - It's good.

742
00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:06.243
- Do you like it? - Yes.

743
00:29:06.342 --> 00:29:08.312
- It's nice. - It's nice, isn't it?

744
00:29:08.412 --> 00:29:10.112
(He already looks hot from behind.)

745
00:29:10.852 --> 00:29:11.912
(It looks good on him.)

746
00:29:12.753 --> 00:29:14.283
- Turn around. - That's nice.

747
00:29:14.283 --> 00:29:15.453
It's nice in the back.

748
00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:17.152
(It's full of swagger. Seong Woo looks hot.)

749
00:29:17.892 --> 00:29:19.352
- Jeong Soo. - Yes.

750
00:29:19.822 --> 00:29:23.322
How about we all wear vintage style like a uniform?

751
00:29:23.322 --> 00:29:25.493
- That's a good idea. - That'd be nice.

752
00:29:25.993 --> 00:29:27.062
He's out.

753
00:29:27.062 --> 00:29:28.933
(Joong Wan looks better than expected.)

754
00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.003
You look great.

755
00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:32.072
It looks good on you.

756
00:29:32.072 --> 00:29:33.973
- It looks good on you. - It looks good on you. Yes.

757
00:29:34.602 --> 00:29:37.872
It's stylish when you don't take the tag off.

758
00:29:39.412 --> 00:29:41.513
(Stylish... Cuteness...)

759
00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.912
You're cute.

760
00:29:43.543 --> 00:29:45.213
I found a jumpsuit.

761
00:29:45.213 --> 00:29:46.253
(Daniel puts on a jumpsuit.)

762
00:29:46.612 --> 00:29:48.082
Oh, that looks like an astronaut.

763
00:29:48.152 --> 00:29:49.253
It looks good on you.

764
00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:51.592
It's a good choice.

765
00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:52.993
Browse around.

766
00:29:52.993 --> 00:29:54.622
(When you tie the top around your waist...)

767
00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:59.433
- Yes. - Yes.

768
00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:01.402
- Fashion people. - Yes.

769
00:30:01.402 --> 00:30:03.832
- Fashion people. - Yes.

770
00:30:03.832 --> 00:30:05.033
Oh, yes.

771
00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:07.243
- We're stylish. - Yes.

772
00:30:07.342 --> 00:30:08.372
(Where's Jeong Soo?)

773
00:30:09.302 --> 00:30:12.312
(Someone kicks the door as he appears.)

774
00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:13.812
Your pants are ripped.

775
00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.082
Oh, Jeong Soo.

776
00:30:16.183 --> 00:30:17.953
(He still has baby fat.)

777
00:30:18.412 --> 00:30:19.483
(Toddling)

778
00:30:20.013 --> 00:30:21.322
(Watch this.)

779
00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.693
It's Deux. Do you know Deux?

780
00:30:23.693 --> 00:30:26.122
I was called Seo Tae Soo. I danced in the past.

781
00:30:27.293 --> 00:30:29.662
(The best dance duo, Deux in 1990s)

782
00:30:30.592 --> 00:30:33.592
(Overalls were the fashion trend back then.)

783
00:30:35.203 --> 00:30:36.332
(That's why we prepared this!)

784
00:30:36.733 --> 00:30:37.933
It's so old-school.

785
00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:39.203
Nice. It looks awesome.

786
00:30:39.203 --> 00:30:40.203
(Excited)

787
00:30:40.703 --> 00:30:42.773
(Seong Woo dances to the beat.)

788
00:30:42.773 --> 00:30:45.013
It's so old-school. Oh, my.

789
00:30:45.013 --> 00:30:46.473
(He instinctually picked up the old-school dance.)

790
00:30:46.473 --> 00:30:48.483
Hey, are you going to keep on dancing? Keep it short.

791
00:30:48.483 --> 00:30:50.983
- Why is your dance so cool? - Hey.

792
00:30:51.953 --> 00:30:53.983
(Nobody expected him to shine through old-school dance.)

793
00:30:54.382 --> 00:30:56.753
- He should've kept it short. - Oh, my.

794
00:30:56.753 --> 00:30:57.953
He should've made it funny.

795
00:30:57.953 --> 00:31:00.523
Exactly. Gosh, how are we going to dance after that?

796
00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:02.662
- Hey, Jae Hwan. - I feel pressured to look cool.

797
00:31:02.662 --> 00:31:04.662
- I'm thinking about what I... - You feel pressured?

798
00:31:05.162 --> 00:31:06.493
(Dancing)

799
00:31:07.033 --> 00:31:08.632
(Left to right)

800
00:31:08.862 --> 00:31:10.933
These guys just don't keep it short.

801
00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:12.433
(His repetitive dance is addictive.)

802
00:31:14.102 --> 00:31:15.902
Sorry, I'm sorry.

803
00:31:15.973 --> 00:31:17.213
(After that, )

804
00:31:17.213 --> 00:31:18.943
(he smoothly exits the dance floor.)

805
00:31:19.142 --> 00:31:20.912
- How much? - Oh, it's my turn now.

806
00:31:21.443 --> 00:31:22.713
(Watch it, NASA.)

807
00:31:22.713 --> 00:31:24.683
(Kang Daniel is here.)

808
00:31:26.812 --> 00:31:28.183
(This one is making sound effects.)

809
00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:31.293
(He's looking sexier than ever.)

810
00:31:32.152 --> 00:31:33.923
(Mom, I want to go home.)

811
00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:37.733
(His dance was sexy enough to seduce all planets in the universe.)

812
00:31:38.493 --> 00:31:40.193
(All of them emulated Deux's dance perfectly.)

813
00:31:41.102 --> 00:31:43.703
(Joong Wan hits the dance floor as "In Summer" starts playing.)

814
00:31:45.173 --> 00:31:46.902
(Wriggling)

815
00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:48.842
(What did I just see?)

816
00:31:49.673 --> 00:31:52.773
(No one knows where he got these moves.)

817
00:31:53.612 --> 00:31:56.412
(Is he angry or what?)

818
00:31:58.112 --> 00:31:59.513
(He has a killer smile.)

819
00:32:00.052 --> 00:32:01.152
You're the last one.

820
00:32:02.622 --> 00:32:04.852
(Kids, let me show you how it should be done.)

821
00:32:06.052 --> 00:32:08.392
(He starts dancing to the rhythm of the song, "As I Told You".)

822
00:32:08.822 --> 00:32:11.162
- This reminds me of Firetruck. - Oh, my. Look at him.

823
00:32:11.392 --> 00:32:13.963
- Firetruck. - It reminds me of their dance.

824
00:32:13.963 --> 00:32:15.362
(His dance moves look ancient.)

825
00:32:16.003 --> 00:32:17.602
My gosh, he's so cute.

826
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.302
(Let's go! "Top 10 Songs"!)

827
00:32:20.132 --> 00:32:23.713
(His dance transports us to 1987, the year Firetruck debuted.)

828
00:32:24.473 --> 00:32:25.973
(Respect)

829
00:32:26.872 --> 00:32:28.912
(The housemates bonded over the overalls...)

830
00:32:28.912 --> 00:32:31.352
(and their memories of Deux.)

831
00:32:32.382 --> 00:32:34.223
(Ong is goofy but cool.)

832
00:32:34.223 --> 00:32:36.152
(Niel is a glutton.)

833
00:32:36.152 --> 00:32:38.023
(Hwan always laughs heartily.)

834
00:32:38.552 --> 00:32:39.993
(And these two are just adults.)

835
00:32:40.963 --> 00:32:44.892
(We're Ong Niel Hwan Yook Soo.)

836
00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:47.862
When we put on those overalls together,

837
00:32:47.862 --> 00:32:50.503
I felt like we were one.

838
00:32:50.673 --> 00:32:53.572
It really felt like we're a team.

839
00:32:54.543 --> 00:32:58.443
(After putting on the overalls, )

840
00:32:59.112 --> 00:33:01.713
(they're headed somewhere together. Where are they going?)

841
00:33:02.743 --> 00:33:05.713
Welcome to Mangwon Market.

842
00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:08.552
- Mangwon Market. - Mangwon Market.

843
00:33:08.552 --> 00:33:10.122
Let's go. We're at Mangwon Market.

844
00:33:10.392 --> 00:33:12.293
I love this smell. All markets smell like this.

845
00:33:12.293 --> 00:33:14.763
- This smell. It smells so good. - I love it.

846
00:33:14.763 --> 00:33:16.763
- There are so many things to eat. - Of course.

847
00:33:16.763 --> 00:33:18.092
(Why are they here?)

848
00:33:18.193 --> 00:33:20.463
(Rose Motel)

849
00:33:20.533 --> 00:33:22.302
- That hotteok looks so good. - Hey, look.

850
00:33:23.132 --> 00:33:24.372
- Right here. - It's Joong Wan.

851
00:33:24.372 --> 00:33:25.473
(Joong Wan's face is everywhere.)

852
00:33:25.473 --> 00:33:28.072
Joong Wan, we see your face wherever we go.

853
00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.372
Joong Wan, you're everywhere.

854
00:33:29.372 --> 00:33:32.513
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

855
00:33:32.513 --> 00:33:34.582
- There's hotteok. - Happy New Year.

856
00:33:34.713 --> 00:33:37.713
Shall we grill the meat or boil it?

857
00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:40.652
- Well, shouldn't we use some fire? - Yes, I agree.

858
00:33:40.652 --> 00:33:42.453
- Let's use some fire. - Yes, we should.

859
00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.293
By the way, is there a place for us to sleep?

860
00:33:44.293 --> 00:33:46.352
- Of course. - Really?

861
00:33:46.352 --> 00:33:48.362
- He said that he knows a place. - That's right.

862
00:33:48.862 --> 00:33:52.132
(One of his requirements was getting away from apartment complexes.)

863
00:33:53.162 --> 00:33:55.503
(He wanted to go to either Gapyeong or Yangpyeong for fresh air.)

864
00:33:56.162 --> 00:33:58.003
(I want to go there soon.)

865
00:33:58.533 --> 00:34:00.443
- Meat. - Meat.

866
00:34:00.443 --> 00:34:01.443
Meat.

867
00:34:01.443 --> 00:34:02.743
- We had pork earlier. - I want beef.

868
00:34:02.743 --> 00:34:03.812
(I want beef.)

869
00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:05.513
- Let's get beef. - Okay.

870
00:34:05.513 --> 00:34:07.783
- Get beef. - We'd like some beef.

871
00:34:07.882 --> 00:34:09.812
My gosh, who said he wants to eat beef?

872
00:34:09.812 --> 00:34:11.383
- Five of this? - No.

873
00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:12.713
You also have pork belly, right?

874
00:34:12.713 --> 00:34:14.952
- Thank you. - Happy New Year.

875
00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.653
- Do we need any side dishes? - Shall we get kimchi?

876
00:34:16.653 --> 00:34:18.693
Then, let's get kimchi. Buy this one and...

877
00:34:18.693 --> 00:34:20.523
I'm also getting ssamjang and chojang.

878
00:34:20.693 --> 00:34:21.762
- Chips. - Goodness.

879
00:34:22.762 --> 00:34:24.463
(Alcohol is a must.)

880
00:34:26.293 --> 00:34:28.863
- Five guys are going on a trip. - It's nice.

881
00:34:28.863 --> 00:34:30.202
Are we going to Gapyeong?

882
00:34:30.202 --> 00:34:31.872
Yes, that's where we're headed.

883
00:34:32.173 --> 00:34:33.773
I saw photos of the place,

884
00:34:33.943 --> 00:34:35.803
and it's very romantic.

885
00:34:35.843 --> 00:34:36.903
(Excited)

886
00:34:37.613 --> 00:34:41.613
I heard that there's a sledding slope in Gapyeong.

887
00:34:41.613 --> 00:34:43.883
Really? Then we should check it out tomorrow.

888
00:34:43.883 --> 00:34:45.582
- Shall we go there tomorrow? - What's in Gapyeong?

889
00:34:45.582 --> 00:34:46.613
A sledding slope.

890
00:34:46.613 --> 00:34:47.983
I didn't get a chance to go.

891
00:34:47.983 --> 00:34:49.983
- You've never done it? - I couldn't this year.

892
00:34:49.983 --> 00:34:52.023
Is that right? Then you can do it there.

893
00:34:52.122 --> 00:34:54.992
Oh, shall we listen to Jeong Soo's song?

894
00:34:55.423 --> 00:34:56.492
- Good idea. - I'd love to.

895
00:34:56.492 --> 00:34:57.633
- My song? - Yes.

896
00:34:57.992 --> 00:34:59.863
(He released "You're the Boss" with Kim Sook in 2016.)

897
00:34:59.863 --> 00:35:02.262
What is the matter with you? Goodness.

898
00:35:02.262 --> 00:35:04.432
(Seong Woo is today's DJ.)

899
00:35:05.073 --> 00:35:08.372
(Among so many people in the whole wide world)

900
00:35:08.972 --> 00:35:10.242
(We'll make your song...)

901
00:35:10.242 --> 00:35:11.613
(sound even more fun.)

902
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.983
(The trot song is making the 2 old guys dance.)

903
00:35:16.613 --> 00:35:17.753
(Immersed)

904
00:35:17.753 --> 00:35:18.952
Kim Sook.

905
00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:21.182
(Because it's you)

906
00:35:21.983 --> 00:35:23.653
Because it's you

907
00:35:24.452 --> 00:35:27.423
(The next song is "Energetic" by Wanna One.)

908

909
00:35:30.832 --> 00:35:33.562
(We get to hear Ong Niel Hwan singing live.)

910
00:35:33.963 --> 00:35:35.133
Amazing.

911
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.162
I can't stop

912
00:35:36.162 --> 00:35:37.773
Can't, can't, can't

913
00:35:38.332 --> 00:35:39.403
(Jeong Soo is so excited.)

914
00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:41.102
It was you, Ong!

915
00:35:42.403 --> 00:35:43.912
(Proud)

916
00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.512
Wow!

917
00:35:46.073 --> 00:35:47.343
Gosh, this is so nice.

918
00:35:48.742 --> 00:35:50.782
(Silent)

919
00:35:52.082 --> 00:35:53.582
Daniel, which part did you sing?

920
00:35:53.613 --> 00:35:55.653
- You have to wait a bit. - You'll hear his rap soon.

921
00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.693
- We'll wait. - You have to wait a little while.

922
00:35:57.693 --> 00:35:59.653
- We'll wait for you, Daniel. - That's so funny.

923
00:35:59.852 --> 00:36:01.593
It's coming. Here we go!

924
00:36:03.392 --> 00:36:04.562
(Tell me how you feel)

925
00:36:05.233 --> 00:36:08.803
(It's finally my part.)

926
00:36:10.633 --> 00:36:13.303
(While they're having fun, )

927
00:36:13.303 --> 00:36:14.903
(they go further into the forest.)

928
00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:18.142
Oh, gosh. I just saw a deer.

929
00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:19.843
(The deer crossed the road so quickly.)

930
00:36:20.843 --> 00:36:22.312
- Where? - It just passed by right there.

931
00:36:22.312 --> 00:36:23.883
- What passed by? - Just now.

932
00:36:23.883 --> 00:36:25.852
- Right in front of our car. - You saw an animal?

933
00:36:25.852 --> 00:36:27.622
- A deer just walked by? - Seriously?

934
00:36:27.622 --> 00:36:28.852
It was probably an elk, not a deer.

935
00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:30.492
- It walked like this. - Oh, my.

936
00:36:30.492 --> 00:36:33.222
I wanted to show you guys nature, you know.

937
00:36:33.222 --> 00:36:34.923
- It's like being on safari. - I didn't see it.

938
00:36:34.923 --> 00:36:36.662
Does that mean we came too far?

939
00:36:36.662 --> 00:36:39.693
Hey, I think we're almost at the demarcation line.

940
00:36:39.693 --> 00:36:42.262
Are you trying to take Korean top celebrities to the North?

941
00:36:42.262 --> 00:36:43.832
(Are you taking Wanna One to North Korea?)

942
00:36:44.173 --> 00:36:46.503
They'll stop our car and go, "Come out."

943
00:36:47.403 --> 00:36:49.503
- You're good at so many things. - You can even imitate their accent.

944
00:36:49.503 --> 00:36:52.043
Why were you so quiet earlier?

945
00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:54.412
I wanted to joke around, but I wasn't sure if it'd be okay.

946
00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:55.742
Why not? Just do it.

947
00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:57.412
(Then, shall I do it too?)

948
00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:59.782
You punk, you never misbehave yourself like this.

949
00:37:00.082 --> 00:37:01.082
(Cracking up)

950
00:37:01.082 --> 00:37:04.193
- What did you say? Do it again. - What was that about?

951
00:37:04.553 --> 00:37:06.992
(He did an impression of a character in "The Outlaws".)

952
00:37:07.863 --> 00:37:10.162
You punk, you never misbehave yourself like this.

953
00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:11.432
(Seong Woo sounds exactly like him.)

954
00:37:11.432 --> 00:37:14.633
Why did you do an impression of a character that nobody imitates?

955
00:37:14.633 --> 00:37:16.432
(Seong Woo has a rare talent.)

956
00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:19.073
My gosh, the moon looks so beautiful.

957
00:37:20.003 --> 00:37:21.102
We're here.

958
00:37:21.102 --> 00:37:22.642
(They've arrived at the resort in Gapyeong.)

959
00:37:22.702 --> 00:37:23.843
I'm so excited.

960
00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:25.972
A bit of snow has piled up.

961
00:37:25.972 --> 00:37:28.242
My gosh, it's beautiful. Look at the snow.

962
00:37:28.242 --> 00:37:29.642
- Just look at that. - I know.

963
00:37:29.642 --> 00:37:32.553
- Look to your left. - Oh, my.

964
00:37:32.782 --> 00:37:33.952
(Marveling)

965
00:37:34.483 --> 00:37:36.082
- Isn't it so picturesque? - My gosh!

966
00:37:36.082 --> 00:37:37.392
Thank you.

967
00:37:38.253 --> 00:37:40.193
You thought it was that place, right?

968
00:37:40.193 --> 00:37:41.492
- It's over there. - Seriously?

969
00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:42.593
- Sorry? - Are you serious?

970
00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.032
It's not a resort though.

971
00:37:44.233 --> 00:37:45.633
It's an abandoned school.

972
00:37:46.193 --> 00:37:49.332
(This abandoned school might give you nightmares.)

973
00:37:50.702 --> 00:37:51.733
(Give me my slippers!)

974
00:37:54.903 --> 00:37:56.073
(Resentment)

975
00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:57.273
(In denial)

976
00:37:58.573 --> 00:37:59.972
(They run away.)

977
00:37:59.972 --> 00:38:02.312
- Get in the car! Hurry up. - Guys, come back.

978
00:38:02.312 --> 00:38:04.312
- Get in the car. - Hurry.

979
00:38:04.312 --> 00:38:06.352
(They're not ready to accept their reality.)

980
00:38:06.352 --> 00:38:08.553
- Are we really sleeping here? - Yes, we are.

981
00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:10.122
- You're kidding, right? - We'll hang out here...

982
00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:11.122
and sleep there, right?

983
00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.892
I saw some photos, and it's such a cute place.

984
00:38:13.892 --> 00:38:15.193
I'm serious. You guys will love it.

985
00:38:15.193 --> 00:38:16.793
- Is this for real? - Jeong Soo, you'll love it.

986
00:38:16.793 --> 00:38:18.332
Why are you doing this to us?

987
00:38:19.693 --> 00:38:21.262
(They're still in denial.)

988
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.832
I really wanted to run away.

989
00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:26.233
He said that it really is an abandoned school.

990
00:38:26.233 --> 00:38:27.503
I wondered if we'd be able...

991
00:38:27.503 --> 00:38:29.903
to sleep there and how cold it'd be inside. I was very worried.

992
00:38:30.673 --> 00:38:31.742
Gosh, I'm anxious now.

993
00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.343
Just go in and take a look.

994
00:38:33.412 --> 00:38:34.682
- No way. - Isn't it kind of quaint?

995
00:38:34.682 --> 00:38:36.082
- Oh, what is this? - Why?

996
00:38:36.082 --> 00:38:37.582
Doesn't it feel like you're visiting your grandma?

997
00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:38.812
(Well, that's a bonus.)

998
00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:42.553
(They muster up the courage to open the door.)

999
00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:44.693
Ta-da.

1000
00:38:46.153 --> 00:38:49.122
(It's sort of cute and quaint inside.)

1001
00:38:51.093 --> 00:38:52.432
(Surprised)

1002
00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:55.032
Gosh, this is perfect.

1003
00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:57.003
(Relieved)

1004
00:38:57.003 --> 00:38:58.673
- Yes, bring that. - It's warm.

1005
00:38:59.073 --> 00:39:01.102
- It's perfect. - Gosh, I...

1006
00:39:01.102 --> 00:39:02.273
It's really perfect.

1007
00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:04.742
But I still don't think I'll be able to go to the bathroom alone.

1008
00:39:06.543 --> 00:39:09.113
(They can definitely relate to what Jae Hwan said.)

1009
00:39:09.843 --> 00:39:12.852
What's up with your faces? Why does everyone look so...

1010
00:39:12.852 --> 00:39:14.323
I'm too happy right now.

1011
00:39:14.383 --> 00:39:15.722
How about we reminisce the old days?

1012
00:39:15.722 --> 00:39:18.023
Writing on the blackboard will send us on a trip down the memory lane.

1013
00:39:18.023 --> 00:39:19.093
No, I don't want to.

1014
00:39:19.722 --> 00:39:21.363
(They need some time to accept their reality.)

1015
00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.762
Since we're hungry, how about we eat some sweet and sour chicken?

1016
00:39:24.932 --> 00:39:27.432
- Let's just snack on it. - Sweet and sour chicken.

1017
00:39:27.463 --> 00:39:28.463
We shouldn't eat too much now.

1018
00:39:28.463 --> 00:39:29.733
It's from Mangwon Market.

1019
00:39:30.372 --> 00:39:31.403
(Oh, my.)

1020
00:39:31.403 --> 00:39:33.233
- It looks so good. - It's mouthwatering.

1021
00:39:33.233 --> 00:39:35.503
- It looks really tasty. - It looks so good.

1022
00:39:35.503 --> 00:39:38.713
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors and only have the winner eat it?

1023
00:39:40.113 --> 00:39:42.983
- Great idea. I'm in. - You want to do it?

1024
00:39:43.043 --> 00:39:46.082
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1025
00:39:46.082 --> 00:39:47.823
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1026
00:39:47.823 --> 00:39:49.553
(Jae Hwan and Joong Wan won.)

1027
00:39:50.122 --> 00:39:51.423
(Screaming)

1028
00:39:53.193 --> 00:39:55.593
Rock... Rock-paper-scissors!

1029
00:39:55.963 --> 00:39:57.633
(Jae Hwan is the winner.)

1030
00:39:58.532 --> 00:39:59.793
- I want to eat this. - You'll eat that piece?

1031
00:39:59.793 --> 00:40:02.003
- This is too cruel. - Seriously.

1032
00:40:03.003 --> 00:40:04.472
- How is it? - It's unbelievable.

1033
00:40:04.472 --> 00:40:05.972
- Unbelievably good? - Is it good?

1034
00:40:05.972 --> 00:40:07.573
- It's amazing. - Isn't it delicious?

1035
00:40:07.573 --> 00:40:08.742
It's really good.

1036
00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.543
- You should... - I can't take this.

1037
00:40:10.543 --> 00:40:12.242
- Hey. - You can't do that!

1038
00:40:12.472 --> 00:40:14.282
(The delicious aroma gets Daniel all excited.)

1039
00:40:14.713 --> 00:40:16.582
We should taste the other ones too. One more round.

1040
00:40:16.582 --> 00:40:18.483
All right, guys. Rock-paper-scissors!

1041
00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:19.952
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1042
00:40:20.622 --> 00:40:21.823
Rock-paper-scissors!

1043
00:40:22.023 --> 00:40:23.023
(Screaming)

1044
00:40:24.053 --> 00:40:26.193
(Rock–paper–scissors makes this 47-year-old man scream excitedly.)

1045
00:40:27.593 --> 00:40:29.622
(These guys are extremely disappointed.)

1046
00:40:29.793 --> 00:40:31.992
Gosh, there are only two pieces of that left.

1047
00:40:32.562 --> 00:40:34.633
- Okay. - I really want to win this time.

1048
00:40:34.633 --> 00:40:35.762
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1049
00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:37.432
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1050
00:40:37.432 --> 00:40:38.472
(They're so into it.)

1051
00:40:39.573 --> 00:40:40.673
Rock-paper-scissors.

1052
00:40:41.073 --> 00:40:43.573
(But Jae Hwan wins again.)

1053
00:40:45.012 --> 00:40:46.073
(Darn it.)

1054
00:40:47.282 --> 00:40:49.642
Thank you. Let me taste another flavor.

1055
00:40:49.642 --> 00:40:50.912
I can't tolerate anymore.

1056
00:40:51.113 --> 00:40:53.213
- Another flavor. - I can't.

1057
00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:54.722
I'm trying another flavor.

1058
00:40:54.722 --> 00:40:55.753
Please hang in there.

1059
00:40:55.923 --> 00:40:57.693
We should stick to the rule.

1060
00:40:57.693 --> 00:40:58.693
(Delicious and funny)

1061
00:40:58.753 --> 00:41:00.923
- As soon as we violate the rule, - Jae Hwan...

1062
00:41:00.923 --> 00:41:01.923
we'll be like animals.

1063
00:41:01.923 --> 00:41:03.093
Let's try again.

1064
00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.963
All right. Rock-paper-scissors.

1065
00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.032
(They're gradually falling for the game.)

1066
00:41:07.863 --> 00:41:10.372
(The losers are eliminated without mercy.)

1067
00:41:10.372 --> 00:41:11.602
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Go, Daniel.

1068
00:41:12.273 --> 00:41:13.673
(It's the cruel world of competition.)

1069
00:41:14.142 --> 00:41:15.173
You lose.

1070
00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:16.403
I'm telling you to lose.

1071
00:41:16.773 --> 00:41:18.512
Rock-paper-scissors.

1072
00:41:18.912 --> 00:41:20.242
(Jae Hwan wins again.)

1073
00:41:21.383 --> 00:41:22.782
(Screaming)

1074
00:41:23.883 --> 00:41:25.452
(He's writhing in the agony of his misfortune.)

1075
00:41:25.452 --> 00:41:27.753
What shall I eat now? There are three flavors, right?

1076
00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:28.952
- Gosh. - I'm so lucky.

1077
00:41:29.182 --> 00:41:30.952
That's one piece.

1078
00:41:31.323 --> 00:41:32.323
Is it a different flavor?

1079
00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.562
Let's play it again right now.

1080
00:41:34.762 --> 00:41:37.363
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1081
00:41:37.363 --> 00:41:39.233
(Once they start, they can't stop playing it.)

1082
00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:40.662
- Now I'm... - Oh, you won.

1083
00:41:40.662 --> 00:41:42.403
- in the final. - They're new faces.

1084
00:41:42.403 --> 00:41:44.372
The new faces made it to the final this time.

1085
00:41:44.532 --> 00:41:46.432
- I'll play rock. - Don't say such a thing.

1086
00:41:46.432 --> 00:41:47.443
- Don't. - I really will.

1087
00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:48.872
- Don't say that. - I will really play rock.

1088
00:41:48.872 --> 00:41:50.202
- Please. - I really will.

1089
00:41:50.202 --> 00:41:51.273
I will play rock.

1090
00:41:51.312 --> 00:41:53.043
Rock-paper-scissors.

1091
00:41:53.682 --> 00:41:55.182
(Daniel wins.)

1092
00:41:56.043 --> 00:41:57.253
(The two of them lose.)

1093
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.852
The star of this night

1094
00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:02.952
is me, it's me

1095
00:42:02.952 --> 00:42:05.492
(I'm the one who will eat the chicken.)

1096
00:42:07.363 --> 00:42:08.793
What flavor are you going to eat?

1097
00:42:08.863 --> 00:42:10.662
I guess people are drawn to things most attractive.

1098
00:42:10.662 --> 00:42:11.693
This is funny.

1099
00:42:11.693 --> 00:42:12.762
(Taking a bite)

1100
00:42:15.162 --> 00:42:16.332
- Isn't it good? - Is it special?

1101
00:42:17.532 --> 00:42:19.003
(There is one person who watches everyone eat.)

1102
00:42:20.372 --> 00:42:22.403
There are only a few pieces left. There is only one piece.

1103
00:42:22.503 --> 00:42:23.912
- I said... - There is only a piece left.

1104
00:42:23.912 --> 00:42:25.443
I said I'd play rock, and how could you...

1105
00:42:25.472 --> 00:42:26.773
try to beat me?

1106
00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:29.443
You said you'd play rock,

1107
00:42:30.653 --> 00:42:32.012
but how could you change like that?

1108
00:42:33.483 --> 00:42:35.483
(The last piece of mustard flavor chicken is on the line.)

1109
00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:37.492
(The crucial match...)

1110
00:42:37.492 --> 00:42:40.053
(of the five guys)

1111
00:42:40.762 --> 00:42:42.093
(Let's go.)

1112
00:42:42.423 --> 00:42:45.293
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1113
00:42:46.062 --> 00:42:47.303
(Seong Woo loses.)

1114
00:42:48.162 --> 00:42:49.303
For goodness' sake.

1115
00:42:49.532 --> 00:42:52.532
This is too harsh. Goodness.

1116
00:42:53.372 --> 00:42:55.503
(He feels angry and sad as well.)

1117
00:42:57.372 --> 00:42:58.372
Rock-paper-scissors.

1118
00:42:58.573 --> 00:42:59.642
(The final winner is Joong Wan.)

1119
00:42:59.642 --> 00:43:01.213
- Gosh. - He's finally eating.

1120
00:43:01.213 --> 00:43:03.713
He could have yielded to Seong Woo.

1121
00:43:04.483 --> 00:43:06.213
(Their friendship doesn't matter in front of the chicken.)

1122
00:43:06.213 --> 00:43:07.483
I'm so hungry.

1123
00:43:07.983 --> 00:43:09.653
- Let's eat together now. - Okay.

1124
00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:10.892
(They decide to eat it together now.)

1125
00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:12.392
I wanted to taste the rice cake too.

1126
00:43:12.392 --> 00:43:13.553
(Their hands get busy, )

1127
00:43:14.262 --> 00:43:15.392
(and they take a bite.)

1128
00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:17.392
- The rice cake is really good. - Eat up.

1129
00:43:17.392 --> 00:43:18.593
- Eat. - I'm done.

1130
00:43:18.832 --> 00:43:20.062
(Gosh)

1131
00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:22.903
(Seong Woo faces misfortune again.)

1132
00:43:22.903 --> 00:43:24.303
What did you do?

1133
00:43:24.303 --> 00:43:25.903
- Pick it up and eat it. - It's okay within three seconds.

1134
00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:26.932
It's okay to eat it.

1135
00:43:27.403 --> 00:43:28.943
(He picks it up and eats it within 3 seconds.)

1136
00:43:29.102 --> 00:43:30.412
Go ahead and eat the rest.

1137
00:43:30.412 --> 00:43:31.472
(It tastes fantastic.)

1138
00:43:32.742 --> 00:43:34.543
(They eat up all the chicken.)

1139
00:43:35.943 --> 00:43:37.053
I want to change.

1140
00:43:37.053 --> 00:43:38.153
- Let's change. - This is heavy.

1141
00:43:39.852 --> 00:43:40.923
- Let's change. - Let me

1142
00:43:40.923 --> 00:43:41.983
(Seong Woo goes behind the curtain.)

1143
00:43:43.323 --> 00:43:46.023
Change now

1144
00:43:46.992 --> 00:43:49.523
Seong Woo, do you know how sexy you look now?

1145
00:43:50.963 --> 00:43:52.593
(His thin ankles are seen under the curtain.)

1146
00:43:52.593 --> 00:43:54.262
They look like moving sticks.

1147
00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:56.032
Moving sticks?

1148
00:43:56.032 --> 00:43:57.372
(Dancing sticks)

1149
00:43:57.372 --> 00:43:58.432
Look at the hair on his legs.

1150
00:43:59.633 --> 00:44:01.003
I should put on my pajamas too.

1151
00:44:01.003 --> 00:44:02.673
(Jae Hwan also goes...)

1152
00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:04.673
(behind the curtain.)

1153
00:44:07.483 --> 00:44:09.682
Why aren't you wearing underwear?

1154
00:44:09.682 --> 00:44:11.753
- Where is your underwear? - What are you saying...

1155
00:44:12.153 --> 00:44:14.622
- Why aren't you wearing underwear? - Gosh.

1156
00:44:15.483 --> 00:44:17.392
(Screaming and laughing)

1157
00:44:18.153 --> 00:44:19.892
(He runs away as fast as he can.)

1158
00:44:21.222 --> 00:44:22.523
Why aren't you wearing underwear?

1159
00:44:22.523 --> 00:44:23.892
(Gosh. Now, I'm safe.)

1160
00:44:24.932 --> 00:44:26.262
(Coming out carefully)

1161
00:44:27.963 --> 00:44:32.202
(The fashionable member is wearing pajamas with colorful patterns.)

1162
00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:35.472
I'll grill the beef now.

1163
00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:37.372
- Okay. - Okay.

1164
00:44:38.443 --> 00:44:40.383
(Joong Wan is in charge of the beef today.)

1165
00:44:43.312 --> 00:44:45.053
(Checking the temperature)

1166
00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:47.483
(Sizzling)

1167
00:44:48.653 --> 00:44:51.053
(He seasons it with salt and pepper.)

1168
00:44:52.153 --> 00:44:53.352
(Flipping it over)

1169
00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:56.523
The beef smells so good.

1170
00:44:56.523 --> 00:44:57.633
(It's grilled to perfection.)

1171
00:44:59.162 --> 00:45:01.562
(He cuts the meat skillfully.)

1172
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:03.702
(Stirring it...)

1173
00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:05.073
(and shaking the pan)

1174
00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.943
- Do you want to try it? - Yes.

1175
00:45:10.773 --> 00:45:11.972
(Steaming hot)

1176
00:45:11.972 --> 00:45:13.012
How is it?

1177
00:45:13.213 --> 00:45:14.883
It's so juicy.

1178
00:45:17.182 --> 00:45:18.753
(He is touched by his own food.)

1179
00:45:20.423 --> 00:45:21.483
This is so good.

1180
00:45:21.483 --> 00:45:23.122
(The beef is grilled by a meat lover.)

1181
00:45:24.323 --> 00:45:26.423
(Jae Hwan is in charge of cooking the pork belly.)

1182
00:45:27.863 --> 00:45:30.062
(Now, he is controlling a pan instead of a wok.)

1183
00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.062
(Let's grill pork belly meat.)

1184
00:45:34.363 --> 00:45:36.032
(He adds some sausages.)

1185
00:45:37.202 --> 00:45:38.972
(With a half tablespoon of concentration...)

1186
00:45:38.972 --> 00:45:40.372
(and one tablespoon of his sexy tongue, )

1187
00:45:41.443 --> 00:45:43.403
(Jae Hwan's pork belly is complete.)

1188
00:45:43.642 --> 00:45:44.872
Where should I cook it?

1189
00:45:44.872 --> 00:45:46.173
(Daniel is in charge of ramyeon.)

1190
00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:47.182
It's cooked.

1191
00:45:48.082 --> 00:45:49.843
(He usually cooks rice or noodles.)

1192
00:45:49.912 --> 00:45:52.082
- What is that? - Since we don't have green onions,

1193
00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.512
I'll add my secret ingredient, gochujang.

1194
00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.352
(He puts in gochujang...)

1195
00:45:57.952 --> 00:45:59.622
(and adds ramyeon later.)

1196
00:46:01.323 --> 00:46:02.823
(Stirring)

1197
00:46:03.932 --> 00:46:05.463
- Shall I add some cut sausages? - What?

1198
00:46:05.463 --> 00:46:06.762
Shall I add sausages?

1199
00:46:07.062 --> 00:46:08.102
As you wish.

1200
00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:12.332
(Daniel puts whatever he wants.)

1201
00:46:13.102 --> 00:46:14.102
(Daniel suddenly heads out.)

1202
00:46:14.102 --> 00:46:15.173
Gosh. It's cold.

1203
00:46:18.713 --> 00:46:19.912
(He came out in his short sleeves...)

1204
00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.952
(to take the green bottles he hid in the snow.)

1205
00:46:24.753 --> 00:46:25.983
I hope it'll be slightly frozen.

1206
00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.053
(You did a good job, Daniel.)

1207
00:46:27.553 --> 00:46:28.622
Goodness. It's so cold.

1208
00:46:31.293 --> 00:46:32.352
(Rushing in)

1209
00:46:33.963 --> 00:46:36.593
(The five men finish preparing for dinner.)

1210
00:46:37.562 --> 00:46:38.832
- It's good. - Isn't it?

1211
00:46:38.832 --> 00:46:40.733
- Kimchi disappeared. - Kimchi?

1212
00:46:40.733 --> 00:46:42.003
Yes. It disappeared.

1213
00:46:42.602 --> 00:46:44.403
Didn't someone take the kimchi out?

1214
00:46:45.733 --> 00:46:46.872
(I think we bought it in Mangwon Market.)

1215
00:46:46.872 --> 00:46:48.472
It could be in the car.

1216
00:46:49.043 --> 00:46:50.472
- Did you bring kimchi? - I'll go to the car to check.

1217
00:46:50.673 --> 00:46:51.713
Okay, Jeong Soo.

1218
00:46:52.372 --> 00:46:54.282
Now, nobody says, "No. I'll go instead."

1219
00:46:54.742 --> 00:46:56.043
(Embarrassed)

1220
00:46:56.512 --> 00:46:58.213
Don't go. Let's eat this together.

1221
00:46:58.213 --> 00:47:00.253
- You eat first. I'm okay. - The ramyeon is soggy.

1222
00:47:00.253 --> 00:47:02.282
I'm okay because I took an appetite suppressant.

1223
00:47:02.823 --> 00:47:04.593
- Come back quickly, Jeong Soo. - Okay.

1224
00:47:04.593 --> 00:47:05.593
(Jeong Soo goes out.)

1225
00:47:06.622 --> 00:47:08.562
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1226
00:47:09.923 --> 00:47:10.992
(Excited)

1227
00:47:11.863 --> 00:47:13.562
- Awesome. - It's my secret recipe.

1228
00:47:13.733 --> 00:47:14.903
You did a good job.

1229
00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:16.803
- You grilled it well. - Good job.

1230
00:47:16.803 --> 00:47:18.432
(Cockles and fruit salad from the market)

1231
00:47:19.432 --> 00:47:21.773
(Jae Hwan's pork belly meat and sausages)

1232
00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:24.713
(Joong Wan's beef)

1233
00:47:26.773 --> 00:47:28.543
- Is ramyeon good? - Eat it before it gets soggy.

1234
00:47:28.543 --> 00:47:29.543
(They each take some.)

1235
00:47:29.543 --> 00:47:31.312
It's perfect time to eat it now.

1236
00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:35.383
(Jae Han blows on it slowly before eating.)

1237
00:47:37.323 --> 00:47:38.352
(Seong Woo blows on it quickly...)

1238
00:47:38.352 --> 00:47:39.823
(and slurps it in.)

1239
00:47:41.793 --> 00:47:43.262
(Daniel doesn't blow on it but just slurps it.)

1240
00:47:45.093 --> 00:47:47.262
- It's good because we're together. - I agree.

1241
00:47:49.162 --> 00:47:51.673
(The four guys are busy eating.)

1242
00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:53.472
Why is kimchi not here yet?

1243
00:47:55.242 --> 00:47:57.273
Even if Jeong Soo doesn't come, we need the kimchi to come.

1244
00:48:00.012 --> 00:48:01.483
(In the meantime, Jeong Soo...)

1245
00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:05.352
(looks everywhere in the car.)

1246
00:48:06.053 --> 00:48:07.053
I can't find it.

1247
00:48:07.053 --> 00:48:08.553
(But he can't find kimchi.)

1248
00:48:09.423 --> 00:48:11.293
- Hey. - You're here, Jeong Soo.

1249
00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:14.293
Did we really buy kimchi?

1250
00:48:14.463 --> 00:48:15.523
- Yes. - You didn't find it?

1251
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:17.963
I couldn't find it. This is my shirt.

1252
00:48:18.392 --> 00:48:19.532
- Really? - Yes.

1253
00:48:19.532 --> 00:48:20.733
(There is no kimchi?)

1254
00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:22.633
I can't believe it.

1255
00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:24.403
We bought it with the cockles.

1256
00:48:24.803 --> 00:48:26.133
With this one.

1257
00:48:26.133 --> 00:48:27.872
Did she forget to put the kimchi in?

1258
00:48:28.642 --> 00:48:31.242
I don't know what kind of kimchi she gave us.

1259
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:34.912
Green onion kimchi was in the middle,

1260
00:48:35.043 --> 00:48:36.682
and white kimchi was on the left.

1261
00:48:36.682 --> 00:48:39.312
- You wanted the white one, right? - Yes.

1262
00:48:40.682 --> 00:48:43.082
(Daniel picked the white kimchi.)

1263
00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:46.492
Maybe she didn't actually put the kimchi in.

1264
00:48:46.492 --> 00:48:47.523
(Did she forget the kimchi?)

1265
00:48:48.162 --> 00:48:50.222
- Did she leave it out? - Where did that kimchi go?

1266
00:48:50.733 --> 00:48:51.762
We really don't have it.

1267
00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:54.863
(The kimchi is missing, which makes them puzzled.)

1268
00:48:55.662 --> 00:48:58.032
Maybe we can't find it because we made a mess here.

1269
00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.372
It must be somewhere.

1270
00:49:00.372 --> 00:49:01.503
(We'll buy them.)

1271
00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:04.713
(Jae Hwan grabbed the cockles and the rolled omelet.)

1272
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:06.943
(And added the salad at the last moment.)

1273
00:49:07.213 --> 00:49:09.082
(They didn't actually buy kimchi.)

1274
00:49:10.483 --> 00:49:12.182
(It happened because of Jae Hwan, who is eating calmly, )

1275
00:49:13.653 --> 00:49:15.553
(and the rest of them, who remember the wrong story.)

1276
00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:19.293
(The end of Yoon Sherlock's Adventure, Missing Kimchi)

1277
00:49:19.492 --> 00:49:22.762
In fact, Joong Wan prepared both our meals today.

1278
00:49:22.992 --> 00:49:24.293
No, I didn't.

1279
00:49:24.762 --> 00:49:26.793
I can't forget the cheonggukjang yet.

1280
00:49:26.793 --> 00:49:27.863
It was great.

1281
00:49:28.262 --> 00:49:30.702
I thought he'd be a good cook, and he really turned out to be.

1282
00:49:31.903 --> 00:49:34.843
It looks like he can make good cheonggukjang.

1283
00:49:35.742 --> 00:49:37.142
(Laughing)

1284
00:49:37.512 --> 00:49:39.242
- Did you just attack me? - You're slightly upset, aren't you?

1285
00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:41.412
- I was thinking... - No way.

1286
00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.452
I mean you make people feel comfortable...

1287
00:49:44.452 --> 00:49:46.653
- and you're friendly. - He's pretending to be nice.

1288
00:49:47.122 --> 00:49:48.182
Do you want to fight?

1289
00:49:50.023 --> 00:49:51.653
Why do you want to fight?

1290
00:49:51.653 --> 00:49:52.722
(He suggests a game comfortably and friendly.)

1291
00:49:52.753 --> 00:49:53.793
What about wrestling on the snow?

1292
00:49:54.823 --> 00:49:56.593
How about we wrestle in our underwear?

1293
00:49:56.923 --> 00:49:57.963
Okay.

1294
00:49:57.963 --> 00:49:59.032
(Okay. I'm in.)

1295
00:49:59.392 --> 00:50:01.202
(He just laughed not knowing anything at all then.)

1296
00:50:01.602 --> 00:50:03.562
- Look at his bottom. - Gosh.

1297
00:50:03.562 --> 00:50:06.032
- What should he do? - It looks tight now.

1298
00:50:06.932 --> 00:50:07.972
(Seong Woo will be suffering.)

1299
00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:09.073
Goodness.

1300
00:50:09.073 --> 00:50:10.102
I can't believe it.

1301
00:50:10.343 --> 00:50:12.912
- No. - Let's play it.

1302
00:50:12.912 --> 00:50:13.943
No way.

1303
00:50:15.343 --> 00:50:16.742
(The next morning after they had a fun night)

1304
00:50:18.653 --> 00:50:21.682
(He won't wake up even at the alarm sound.)

1305
00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:25.352
(He finally recognizes the alarm sound and wakes up.)

1306
00:50:27.323 --> 00:50:28.823
(What time is it?)

1307
00:50:30.892 --> 00:50:32.693
(The alarm goes off again.)

1308
00:50:33.133 --> 00:50:35.233
(He turns it off and seems to wake up.)

1309
00:50:37.773 --> 00:50:40.742
(But he falls back asleep.)

1310
00:50:42.273 --> 00:50:43.742
(Aren't you going to wake up?)

1311
00:50:45.573 --> 00:50:46.573
(Jumping)

1312
00:50:47.582 --> 00:50:49.782
(Gureum jumps on him to wake him up.)

1313
00:50:51.082 --> 00:50:54.352
(Chan Sung can't resist Gureum and wakes up.)

1314
00:50:55.082 --> 00:50:56.182
Hi.

1315
00:50:57.492 --> 00:50:58.823
(Did I do a good job?)

1316
00:50:59.793 --> 00:51:00.892
Let's wake up.

1317
00:51:02.662 --> 00:51:05.392
(Chan Sung has to go to his musical practice.)

1318
00:51:06.262 --> 00:51:08.332
(Gureum is better than 10 alarm bells.)

1319
00:51:10.032 --> 00:51:11.073
(Chan Sung wakes Woo Young up.)

1320
00:51:11.073 --> 00:51:13.472
(Sorry, Woo Young.)

1321
00:51:16.303 --> 00:51:18.312
(He comes out so that Chan Sung can get ready comfortably.)

1322
00:51:18.312 --> 00:51:20.383
(I'll sleep some more.)

1323
00:51:21.142 --> 00:51:22.983
(Chan Sung is up early in the morning.)

1324
00:51:23.653 --> 00:51:25.983
(He brushes his hair a few times with his hands.)

1325
00:51:27.182 --> 00:51:29.352
(He shows off his looks and is ready to go.)

1326
00:51:29.483 --> 00:51:31.492
Bye. See you later.

1327
00:51:32.253 --> 00:51:34.392
- Go back to sleep. - Bye.

1328
00:51:35.162 --> 00:51:36.963
(He sees Chan Sung off while half asleep.)

1329
00:51:39.233 --> 00:51:43.972
(Chan Sung arrives at the practice room half asleep as well.)

1330
00:51:45.332 --> 00:51:47.142
Cheetah?

1331
00:51:47.702 --> 00:51:48.773
Where's Cheetah?

1332
00:51:49.503 --> 00:51:50.573
Cheetah.

1333
00:51:50.573 --> 00:51:52.642
(After sending Chan Sung off, he acts strangely out of boredom.)

1334
00:51:53.573 --> 00:51:55.213
(He must be very bored.)

1335
00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:56.943
It's strange.

1336
00:51:57.582 --> 00:51:58.682
Is that you, Cheetah?

1337
00:52:00.553 --> 00:52:02.722
- Where's Cheetah? - She's not here.

1338
00:52:03.383 --> 00:52:05.053
- I thought it was Cheetah's house. - She went outside.

1339
00:52:05.053 --> 00:52:06.923
Eun Young is home.

1340
00:52:07.122 --> 00:52:08.392
Goodbye.

1341
00:52:09.823 --> 00:52:11.293
(They start off their morning with laughter.)

1342
00:52:12.093 --> 00:52:15.332
All right. I'll take out some snacks to win their favor.

1343
00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.702
(He takes out the ultimate weapon.)

1344
00:52:18.673 --> 00:52:20.273
(He succeeds to attract Gureum easily.)

1345
00:52:20.773 --> 00:52:22.242
It looks delicious, right?

1346
00:52:22.803 --> 00:52:24.012
Come over here.

1347
00:52:24.512 --> 00:52:26.512
(He captures Buri's attention successfully as well.)

1348
00:52:26.512 --> 00:52:27.613
It looks good, right?

1349
00:52:30.312 --> 00:52:31.812
(Cheetah is up instead of Eun Young.)

1350
00:52:31.812 --> 00:52:32.883
Here.

1351
00:52:33.512 --> 00:52:34.782
(He enjoys a good time with Gureum and Buri.)

1352
00:52:34.782 --> 00:52:36.753
Why aren't they out? It's strange.

1353
00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.452
It's about time they come out too.

1354
00:52:38.753 --> 00:52:39.753
(Their heads turn towards Cheetah.)

1355
00:52:39.753 --> 00:52:41.523
Well, Eun Young...

1356
00:52:41.523 --> 00:52:43.162
Gosh, why? Don't go.

1357
00:52:43.162 --> 00:52:44.992
Because this one is more delicious.

1358
00:52:45.492 --> 00:52:46.562
(Disappointed)

1359
00:52:47.162 --> 00:52:48.332
See? He's out.

1360
00:52:48.432 --> 00:52:49.832
(Tarang, who is hard to get close to, comes out too.)

1361
00:52:50.432 --> 00:52:51.803
(Tarang passes Woo Young without giving him a glance.)

1362
00:52:51.803 --> 00:52:53.903
- Tarang. - Tarang, come here.

1363
00:52:54.003 --> 00:52:55.343
(He tries to draw their attention by showing snacks before their eyes.)

1364
00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.073
(Tarang makes it clear what he likes and dislikes.)

1365
00:52:58.073 --> 00:52:59.773
We can give them snacks together.

1366
00:53:00.713 --> 00:53:02.642
- Tanyang's out. - Hi.

1367
00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:05.082
They don't rest.

1368
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:07.553
Goodness, don't eat the wrapper.

1369
00:53:08.452 --> 00:53:10.753
Tanyang's eating fast.

1370
00:53:11.622 --> 00:53:12.722
There you go.

1371
00:53:13.093 --> 00:53:14.323
Can't we eat something too?

1372
00:53:14.622 --> 00:53:16.262
How about we eat pollock hangover soup?

1373
00:53:16.562 --> 00:53:17.733
- Gosh. - What do you think?

1374
00:53:19.233 --> 00:53:21.162
I like the idea.

1375
00:53:21.733 --> 00:53:23.062
Let's eat pollock hangover soup.

1376
00:53:23.432 --> 00:53:25.832
Let's heat this pollock hangover soup...

1377
00:53:26.073 --> 00:53:28.372
and microwave the fried rice from yesterday.

1378
00:53:28.642 --> 00:53:29.872
- Sounds good. - What do you think?

1379
00:53:29.872 --> 00:53:31.642
- You like the idea? - I love it.

1380
00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:32.843
It's a good plan.

1381
00:53:32.843 --> 00:53:34.642
- Okay. - You must be a genius.

1382
00:53:35.983 --> 00:53:37.952
(Woo Young is in charge of rice.)

1383
00:53:37.952 --> 00:53:40.082
(Cheetah is in charge of soup.)

1384
00:53:40.423 --> 00:53:42.883
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1385
00:53:43.352 --> 00:53:44.523
It's good.

1386
00:53:45.153 --> 00:53:46.153
(Slurping)

1387
00:53:46.852 --> 00:53:48.423
I didn't think you would have hangover soup at home.

1388
00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.693
(She eats her breakfast with her hair messed up.)

1389
00:53:50.693 --> 00:53:53.162
If we go to a mud flat,

1390
00:53:53.803 --> 00:53:56.303
we can catch some octopuses there. It will be fun.

1391
00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.573
(Cheetah's condition was to have a date in Eurwangni.)

1392
00:54:00.233 --> 00:54:02.673
(Eurwangni is a mud flat, not sand beach.)

1393
00:54:03.543 --> 00:54:06.073
We can catch some octopuses there. It will be fun.

1394
00:54:06.273 --> 00:54:08.043
There are octopuses in mud flats?

1395
00:54:08.883 --> 00:54:10.043
You mean, small octopuses?

1396
00:54:10.242 --> 00:54:12.253
- Right. - Small octopuses live in mud.

1397
00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:13.782
You know well.

1398
00:54:15.153 --> 00:54:18.323
They say there are holes.

1399
00:54:18.323 --> 00:54:20.622
- You can find where they... - They're their breath holes.

1400
00:54:21.323 --> 00:54:22.363
You know well.

1401
00:54:22.363 --> 00:54:23.492
(He fails to be a know-it-all.)

1402
00:54:24.133 --> 00:54:25.693
(He drinks up his hangover soup out of embarrassment.)

1403
00:54:25.693 --> 00:54:27.363
You finished it all.

1404
00:54:28.363 --> 00:54:29.503
It's delicious, right?

1405
00:54:30.102 --> 00:54:31.733
(It was the perfect menu.)

1406
00:54:32.432 --> 00:54:33.503
Let's go to Eurwangni.

1407
00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.803
Let's get ready.

1408
00:54:36.202 --> 00:54:38.613
(He prepares for a date with a reverent heart.)

1409
00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:43.213
(She transforms from the innocent Eun Young...)

1410
00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.883
(to the charismatic Cheetah.)

1411
00:54:46.713 --> 00:54:47.782
I'm done.

1412
00:54:49.082 --> 00:54:50.992
(The doorbell rings.)

1413
00:54:53.693 --> 00:54:54.863
(Who is it?)

1414
00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.293
- Hello. - Well, hi.

1415
00:54:59.532 --> 00:55:00.863
Didn't you say you couldn't make it?

1416
00:55:01.162 --> 00:55:02.233
You're here.

1417
00:55:03.303 --> 00:55:05.832
(He's tired and hungry, but he has to go to Eurwangni.)

1418
00:55:08.803 --> 00:55:11.173
Is this real?

1419
00:55:13.782 --> 00:55:15.412
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1420
00:55:15.883 --> 00:55:18.012
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1421
00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:20.823
(They set off first.)

1422
00:55:21.523 --> 00:55:24.122
What are we going to do there?

1423
00:55:24.492 --> 00:55:26.423
How about we go into the mud?

1424
00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.293
You want to go in there?

1425
00:55:28.293 --> 00:55:30.093
Let's catch some small octopuses.

1426
00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:31.363
Let's do it.

1427
00:55:31.363 --> 00:55:33.392
- Let's do it. - Stir-fried small octopuses.

1428
00:55:33.593 --> 00:55:36.303
I've never been to a mud flat before.

1429
00:55:36.832 --> 00:55:39.332
Let's go in for her sake then.

1430
00:55:39.432 --> 00:55:40.872
If that's what she wants.

1431
00:55:41.403 --> 00:55:42.972
- Let's live freely. - Let's do it.

1432
00:55:42.972 --> 00:55:43.972
(Let's go.)

1433
00:55:44.372 --> 00:55:45.843
Did you guys eat something?

1434
00:55:46.073 --> 00:55:47.483
Oh, you didn't?

1435
00:55:47.483 --> 00:55:48.543
Did you have breakfast?

1436
00:55:48.642 --> 00:55:49.883
You didn't?

1437
00:55:50.182 --> 00:55:51.852
I ate a sandwich.

1438
00:55:52.812 --> 00:55:54.153
You ate something delicious.

1439
00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:55.722
Well, we...

1440
00:55:55.722 --> 00:55:57.523
Are you hungry?

1441
00:55:57.622 --> 00:55:59.122
- I am. - Really?

1442
00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.222
I ate breakfast,

1443
00:56:00.222 --> 00:56:01.392
- but I feel like I didn't. - You're hungry, right?

1444
00:56:01.392 --> 00:56:02.463
Yes.

1445
00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:05.863
- Well... - I know you're lying.

1446
00:56:07.403 --> 00:56:10.262
- No, we're telling you the truth. - I'm suddenly getting a headache.

1447
00:56:10.262 --> 00:56:11.503
- It's raining. - What?

1448
00:56:12.472 --> 00:56:14.673
- Check the weather forecast. - Hold on.

1449
00:56:14.943 --> 00:56:16.043
How is it?

1450
00:56:16.943 --> 00:56:21.113
It has 70 percent of rainfall probability.

1451
00:56:21.213 --> 00:56:24.613
We might go there and have a drink with stir-fried small octopuses.

1452
00:56:24.613 --> 00:56:25.713
(They might go in a restaurant instead of the mud.)

1453
00:56:25.713 --> 00:56:26.812
No...

1454
00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:30.423
But I like stir-fried small octopuses.

1455
00:56:30.523 --> 00:56:32.153
I crave spicy food.

1456
00:56:32.153 --> 00:56:34.492
- Right? - Something spicy.

1457
00:56:34.492 --> 00:56:35.722
Spicy food?

1458
00:56:35.823 --> 00:56:36.892
- Is that right? - Spicy food?

1459
00:56:36.892 --> 00:56:38.863
- Should I search for a restaurant? - Good.

1460
00:56:38.863 --> 00:56:39.963
Please do.

1461
00:56:40.432 --> 00:56:42.162
(They drive for quite some time...)

1462
00:56:42.162 --> 00:56:44.133
(while looking up good restaurants in the area.)

1463
00:56:44.673 --> 00:56:46.173
What a nice view.

1464
00:56:46.173 --> 00:56:47.702
(The sky is clear unlike the forecast.)

1465
00:56:47.702 --> 00:56:49.343
We need to do this at times like this.

1466
00:56:49.343 --> 00:56:50.343
(They're in a good mood, )

1467
00:56:50.343 --> 00:56:51.343
(so they open the window.)

1468
00:56:51.343 --> 00:56:52.512
Gosh, it's cold.

1469
00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:54.443
(Wait a second.)

1470
00:56:54.742 --> 00:56:55.843
Yes!

1471
00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:57.653
(The neighborhood fool suddenly appears once again.)

1472
00:56:57.812 --> 00:56:59.012
Goodness, you surprised me.

1473
00:57:01.722 --> 00:57:02.823
(Screaming)

1474
00:57:04.222 --> 00:57:06.423
(He's used to this.)

1475
00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:09.193
(With the excited neighborhood fool, )

1476
00:57:09.193 --> 00:57:10.733
(they continue driving to their destination.)

1477
00:57:12.032 --> 00:57:14.762
- We're here. - We arrived.

1478
00:57:15.403 --> 00:57:17.273
I guess these are quad bikes.

1479
00:57:17.403 --> 00:57:19.173
- Hello. - Hello.

1480
00:57:19.173 --> 00:57:21.102
- Hello. - Hello.

1481
00:57:21.102 --> 00:57:24.213
We want to try riding those quad bikes.

1482
00:57:24.512 --> 00:57:26.943
- You have your licenses, right? - Yes.

1483
00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:28.113
Yes.

1484
00:57:28.983 --> 00:57:30.043
(He gets on the bike first.)

1485
00:57:30.043 --> 00:57:31.153
Like this?

1486
00:57:31.653 --> 00:57:33.352
It looks fun.

1487
00:57:33.923 --> 00:57:35.423
Where will you sit?

1488
00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:37.693
Whose bike are you going to ride?

1489
00:57:38.293 --> 00:57:40.992
Gosh, it feels like a competition this way.

1490
00:57:41.023 --> 00:57:43.423
Cheetah, I always...

1491
00:57:44.332 --> 00:57:45.363
Yes?

1492
00:57:45.363 --> 00:57:46.633
I've always waited for something like this.

1493
00:57:46.633 --> 00:57:47.903
(What's wrong with him?)

1494
00:57:48.233 --> 00:57:49.332
I'm going to ride his bike.

1495
00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:51.273
(She doesn't hesitate and chooses Chan Sung.)

1496
00:57:51.273 --> 00:57:52.733
I've always wanted to have a girl sit behind me.

1497
00:57:52.733 --> 00:57:54.003
(His strategy has caused an adverse effect.)

1498
00:57:54.543 --> 00:57:55.673
It's too late.

1499
00:57:57.213 --> 00:57:58.412
(Disappointed)

1500
00:57:59.073 --> 00:58:00.943
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1501
00:58:00.943 --> 00:58:02.613
Let's go.

1502
00:58:03.043 --> 00:58:04.053
(Screaming)

1503
00:58:04.383 --> 00:58:05.713
You have to hold on tightly.

1504
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.182
No, well...

1505
00:58:08.983 --> 00:58:11.622
No, well... I'm just telling you to be careful.

1506
00:58:12.093 --> 00:58:13.392
Let's go.

1507
00:58:13.392 --> 00:58:15.122
(They head to the beach excitedly.)

1508
00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:19.532
(He's still excited even though he's alone.)

1509
00:58:20.403 --> 00:58:21.762
Here's the mud flat.

1510
00:58:22.162 --> 00:58:23.773
- It's the mud flat. - The mud flat.

1511
00:58:23.972 --> 00:58:25.032
Right.

1512
00:58:25.032 --> 00:58:26.233
(The mud flat is right in front of them.)

1513
00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.043
Wait for me, small octopuses.

1514
00:58:29.503 --> 00:58:30.972
Let's stir-fry small octopuses.

1515
00:58:30.972 --> 00:58:32.173
Wait for me, clams.

1516
00:58:32.412 --> 00:58:33.543
Come on, small octopuses.

1517
00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:34.543
(Both of them, come on.)

1518
00:58:34.742 --> 00:58:35.983
It's great.

1519
00:58:35.983 --> 00:58:37.113
Careful.

1520
00:58:37.412 --> 00:58:39.452
It's like off-road driving.

1521
00:58:39.452 --> 00:58:40.452
(The mud flat shines before them.)

1522
00:58:41.952 --> 00:58:43.622
(They run towards it...)

1523
00:58:43.622 --> 00:58:45.352
(without a hitch.)

1524
00:58:45.923 --> 00:58:48.062
- Eurwangni. - Eurwangni!

1525
00:58:49.722 --> 00:58:51.562
(They're excited.)

1526
00:58:54.062 --> 00:58:55.233
(Laughing)

1527
00:58:55.602 --> 00:58:58.073
(Spitting)

1528
00:58:59.532 --> 00:59:01.043
Sand keeps coming in my mouth.

1529
00:59:02.443 --> 00:59:05.972
(I'm still excited.)

1530
00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:08.182
It's Eurwangni!

1531
00:59:09.242 --> 00:59:11.012
(Let's get it.)

1532
00:59:12.452 --> 00:59:14.383
(They're fully enjoying the speed.)

1533
00:59:16.682 --> 00:59:17.693
(Shouting)

1534
00:59:18.452 --> 00:59:21.392
(They have fun, running against the sea breeze.)

1535
00:59:21.392 --> 00:59:23.162
Come here.

1536
00:59:23.363 --> 00:59:25.093
Let's go together.

1537
00:59:25.863 --> 00:59:27.762
- Let's go. - Yes!

1538
00:59:28.003 --> 00:59:29.162
Let's go.

1539
00:59:29.932 --> 00:59:32.233
(They enjoy freedom away from their daily lives.)

1540
00:59:35.543 --> 00:59:36.773
(Feeling sad)

1541
00:59:38.213 --> 00:59:40.782
(They can't get out of the excitement easily.)

1542
00:59:41.082 --> 00:59:42.412
Gosh, it's awesome.

1543
00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.852
I want to drive it so much.

1544
00:59:43.852 --> 00:59:45.412
I'm going to get a driving license for certain.

1545
00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:47.722
You'll love it.

1546
00:59:48.122 --> 00:59:50.523
- Shall we take a picture together? - Picture?

1547
00:59:50.693 --> 00:59:52.793
- Like this. - I want to ride this some more.

1548
00:59:52.793 --> 00:59:54.062
- Good. - 1, 2, 3.

1549
00:59:54.222 --> 00:59:55.222
(Jumping)

1550
00:59:57.793 --> 01:00:00.062
(Get your driving license beforehand.)

1551
01:00:00.062 --> 01:00:01.832
(The neighborhood fool never disappoints you.)

1552
01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:03.872
(Nothing matters as long as I look good in the picture.)

1553
01:00:04.773 --> 01:00:06.832
- Let's go now. - Be careful.

1554
01:00:07.642 --> 01:00:09.242
(It's not easy from the start.)

1555
01:00:09.242 --> 01:00:10.312
Gosh.

1556
01:00:10.472 --> 01:00:11.512
Is it hard?

1557
01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:14.512
My feet feel wet.

1558
01:00:16.242 --> 01:00:18.782
It feels like going into a shower booth...

1559
01:00:18.912 --> 01:00:21.722
with socks on my feet.

1560
01:00:23.323 --> 01:00:24.952
It feels like stepping on poop.

1561
01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:26.923
(They feel exactly the same.)

1562
01:00:27.363 --> 01:00:29.363
There are a lot of stuff under my feet.

1563
01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.262
- They're... - What are those?

1564
01:00:31.463 --> 01:00:33.193
I want to wear rubber boots.

1565
01:00:34.432 --> 01:00:37.073
- I'll make boots for you with this. - Don't! Don't do that!

1566
01:00:37.073 --> 01:00:38.633
Gosh, seriously!

1567
01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.142
That's what they look like.

1568
01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:43.673
Gosh, I really don't like how this feels.

1569
01:00:44.543 --> 01:00:46.213
You're rapping.

1570
01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:49.282
I'm telling you. She'll write a rap with the word "mud" in three months.

1571
01:00:49.282 --> 01:00:50.282
Let's give it a shot, guys.

1572
01:00:50.282 --> 01:00:52.053
- Okay. - I think we found the right spot.

1573
01:00:52.053 --> 01:00:53.682
Do clams disappear quickly?

1574
01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:55.352
Maybe in the sea, but probably not here.

1575
01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.653
I'm already tired.

1576
01:00:57.093 --> 01:00:59.553
- I don't see anything. - You were energetic when we drank.

1577
01:00:59.653 --> 01:01:01.863
Eun Young, try sitting like this. This posture is pretty comfortable.

1578
01:01:01.963 --> 01:01:03.562
You'll have to give up your bottom though.

1579
01:01:03.562 --> 01:01:04.963
(Give up your bottom for clams.)

1580
01:01:05.562 --> 01:01:06.633
Right here.

1581
01:01:06.633 --> 01:01:10.372
(They endure the uncomfortable posture and keep digging, )

1582
01:01:11.633 --> 01:01:15.003
(but they don't see any clams.)

1583
01:01:15.003 --> 01:01:16.573
I don't think there are any here.

1584
01:01:16.972 --> 01:01:18.773
There are. I found one.

1585
01:01:18.773 --> 01:01:20.242
- What did you find? - A clam.

1586
01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:21.613
We have to fill this up.

1587
01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.952
This is edible, right? I'll put this in.

1588
01:01:24.613 --> 01:01:26.153
Oh, I caught another one.

1589
01:01:26.153 --> 01:01:28.153
- My gosh! - Hey, that one is really big.

1590
01:01:29.122 --> 01:01:31.053
Hey, come here. You're like my war souvenir.

1591
01:01:31.053 --> 01:01:32.423
- Chan Sung. - Yes?

1592
01:01:33.293 --> 01:01:34.423
- What is it? - My gosh!

1593
01:01:35.093 --> 01:01:36.162
Are you serious?

1594
01:01:36.162 --> 01:01:38.193
Hey, is this... Is it even real?

1595
01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:40.293
Hey, hang on. Open it up. It's probably dead or something.

1596
01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.863
No, it's staying closed like that because it's alive.

1597
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.372
- It's heavy. - I told you.

1598
01:01:44.372 --> 01:01:45.573
Why did you smell it?

1599
01:01:45.932 --> 01:01:49.173
Well, I thought it might make it open up on its own.

1600
01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.073
- This is weird. - Oh, I think I caught one.

1601
01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:53.472
(Chan Sung caught his first clam!)

1602
01:01:53.472 --> 01:01:55.383
- Yes! Nice! - Nice!

1603
01:01:55.383 --> 01:01:56.812
I caught another one too.

1604
01:01:56.812 --> 01:01:58.753
Oh, yes. Come on.

1605
01:01:58.753 --> 01:02:00.553
- Okay. - I should just pick up garbage.

1606
01:02:02.023 --> 01:02:03.182
- That thing... - Oh, my.

1607
01:02:03.423 --> 01:02:05.122
Gosh, this is so big.

1608
01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:06.423
Hey, why are you...

1609
01:02:07.622 --> 01:02:10.693
Hey, will I not get to eat any if I catch none?

1610
01:02:10.932 --> 01:02:12.593
- Will you guys eat... - I'm sure that's not the case.

1611
01:02:12.593 --> 01:02:14.503
Right? You guys will share them with me, right?

1612
01:02:14.503 --> 01:02:15.903
We're not petty.

1613
01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:17.273
You caught so many too.

1614
01:02:17.273 --> 01:02:18.932
I've definitely gotten the hang of it.

1615
01:02:18.932 --> 01:02:21.102
The little bit of slump... What's wrong? What happened?

1616
01:02:21.102 --> 01:02:23.403
Look at this. It's dangling.

1617
01:02:23.912 --> 01:02:25.273
It just spread out its legs.

1618
01:02:25.273 --> 01:02:26.613
- I was catching so many... - Hey, look.

1619
01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:28.782
It's... Do you know what it's trying to do now?

1620
01:02:29.182 --> 01:02:30.182
It's doing this.

1621
01:02:30.182 --> 01:02:31.452
(She imitates the crab.)

1622
01:02:31.852 --> 01:02:33.282
It's trying to make itself look bigger.

1623
01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.653
- Okay. I'll let you go, then. - Okay.

1624
01:02:36.952 --> 01:02:38.852
- It looks like the Transformer. - Yes.

1625
01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:42.262
Like this. It goes like this. That sounded like "chicken".

1626
01:02:42.262 --> 01:02:44.693
Gosh, this piece of garbage. Please don't litter.

1627
01:02:44.693 --> 01:02:46.733
(This piece of garbage. Please don't litter.)

1628
01:02:47.562 --> 01:02:49.062
- Were you talking about me? - What?

1629
01:02:49.062 --> 01:02:50.872
Weren't you talking about my lame joke?

1630
01:02:50.872 --> 01:02:53.432
Oh, that piece of garbage. What a coincidence.

1631
01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:56.742
- I thought she called you garbage. - Exactly, me too.

1632
01:02:56.742 --> 01:02:59.773
I'll collect garbage. I'll think that I'm here to do volunteer work.

1633
01:02:59.773 --> 01:03:01.713
Woo Young, you can catch them by just scraping the mud.

1634
01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:04.012
My gosh, another one.

1635
01:03:04.012 --> 01:03:05.553
- Catch clams already. - Yes, sir.

1636
01:03:06.653 --> 01:03:07.923
I can't do it.

1637
01:03:08.722 --> 01:03:10.023
I don't feel confident at all.

1638
01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:13.892
Just scape the mud, and they'll come out like this.

1639
01:03:13.892 --> 01:03:14.923
My gosh.

1640
01:03:14.923 --> 01:03:17.193
That sounded like a straight-A student telling me how to study.

1641
01:03:17.463 --> 01:03:18.832
You'll find them like this.

1642
01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:20.062
I caught another one.

1643
01:03:20.293 --> 01:03:22.162
Yes, it's here. I caught it.

1644
01:03:22.162 --> 01:03:23.363
Gosh, I caught a big one.

1645
01:03:23.363 --> 01:03:24.903
I caught a bigger one.

1646
01:03:24.903 --> 01:03:26.673
Gosh, why are you guys so good at this?

1647
01:03:26.673 --> 01:03:29.472
- Just scrape the mud. - Give it a shot.

1648
01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:30.912
- Oh, I found one. - Where?

1649
01:03:30.912 --> 01:03:32.843
- It's huge! - I told you so!

1650
01:03:33.412 --> 01:03:35.782
Scrape, scrape away. Let's do this.

1651
01:03:37.383 --> 01:03:39.253
- This really works. - I know, right?

1652
01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:41.452
I found a big one. I'm doing so well.

1653
01:03:41.452 --> 01:03:42.722
- Isn't this huge? - That's really big.

1654
01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:43.722
I know, right?

1655
01:03:43.722 --> 01:03:46.253
Cheetah, let's go now.

1656
01:03:46.553 --> 01:03:47.863
We caught so many.

1657
01:03:48.923 --> 01:03:50.162
(Woo Young doesn't want to go yet.)

1658
01:03:50.162 --> 01:03:51.293
Come on, let's go.

1659
01:03:51.593 --> 01:03:52.892
(Get a taste of this mud.)

1660
01:03:55.403 --> 01:03:56.463
Hey, do it to her.

1661
01:03:57.372 --> 01:03:58.532
(Mud delivered)

1662
01:03:58.532 --> 01:03:59.773
Don't. Gosh!

1663
01:03:59.773 --> 01:04:00.773
(And he got it all back.)

1664
01:04:00.943 --> 01:04:02.773
- Are you really going to do this? - No, no.

1665
01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:04.573
No! Don't!

1666
01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:06.872
Fire!

1667
01:04:08.142 --> 01:04:10.512
(She finally got caught.)

1668
01:04:10.512 --> 01:04:11.782
Got you!

1669
01:04:12.253 --> 01:04:14.222
- Woo Young, are you ready? - I'll teach you a lesson.

1670
01:04:14.222 --> 01:04:16.523
- Are you ready? - Let go of me! Don't!

1671
01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.153
(Screaming)

1672
01:04:18.352 --> 01:04:20.363
Have you lost your mind? Don't do this!

1673
01:04:20.363 --> 01:04:22.062
- Will you behave yourself or not? - I will.

1674
01:04:22.062 --> 01:04:24.093
Hey, come over here. Let's go near the water.

1675
01:04:24.363 --> 01:04:26.293
We can't throw her too far. Let's just drop her here.

1676
01:04:26.293 --> 01:04:27.332
- 1. - 2.

1677
01:04:27.332 --> 01:04:28.803
- It'll hurt. - I think it'll hurt.

1678
01:04:28.803 --> 01:04:31.432
- Yes, it will. - Let's do it over there. Come here.

1679
01:04:31.532 --> 01:04:32.832
(He drags her.)

1680
01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:34.872
(She's sledding on the mud flat.)

1681
01:04:37.812 --> 01:04:39.372
Hey, get back here.

1682
01:04:39.372 --> 01:04:40.843
The water here is nice.

1683
01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.383
(Woo Young has become the target.)

1684
01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:44.553
Wait, I caught a clam.

1685
01:04:44.553 --> 01:04:45.983
(Woo Young rebels.)

1686
01:04:46.613 --> 01:04:47.852
(Exhausted)

1687
01:04:48.553 --> 01:04:50.793
Let's play rock-paper-scissors. The loser will have to...

1688
01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.523
lie on the mud.

1689
01:04:52.523 --> 01:04:53.762
Not face down.

1690
01:04:53.762 --> 01:04:55.562
- The loser? - Flop down like this.

1691
01:04:55.562 --> 01:04:59.432
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1692
01:04:59.432 --> 01:05:01.303
(Woo Young won.)

1693
01:05:03.062 --> 01:05:04.472
I won because I did all the dishes!

1694
01:05:05.003 --> 01:05:06.173
(These two are depressed.)

1695
01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.142
Now, you two should do it again. Come on.

1696
01:05:08.142 --> 01:05:10.003
- Okay, all right. - I washed all the dishes.

1697
01:05:10.003 --> 01:05:12.242
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

1698
01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:13.713
(Chan Sung is the loser.)

1699
01:05:14.282 --> 01:05:15.742
I told you that we should do it together.

1700
01:05:15.742 --> 01:05:17.483
- Try it. - I can't.

1701
01:05:17.483 --> 01:05:18.483
Do it.

1702
01:05:18.483 --> 01:05:20.282
No, you have to do it yourself.

1703
01:05:20.282 --> 01:05:21.483
Why do I have to?

1704
01:05:21.483 --> 01:05:23.383
- Because you lost. - All right.

1705
01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:24.593
(Chan Sung grabs him.)

1706
01:05:25.793 --> 01:05:27.722
(He tries to get out, but he can't.)

1707
01:05:28.023 --> 01:05:30.222
Well, you... You lost.

1708
01:05:30.662 --> 01:05:32.392
Cheetah, you're not going to help me?

1709
01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.562
Come on. Help me.

1710
01:05:34.562 --> 01:05:35.602
(Chan Sung knocks him out.)

1711
01:05:35.963 --> 01:05:37.432
Come on. Help me.

1712
01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.733
(Woo Young ended up serving the penalty.)

1713
01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:43.912
(He runs on all fours.)

1714
01:05:45.573 --> 01:05:47.912
(You're witnessing what such a penalty can do to an idol singer.)

1715
01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:50.452
(Chan Sung is scared.)

1716
01:05:50.883 --> 01:05:52.253
Hey, you're scaring me!

1717
01:05:53.113 --> 01:05:54.253
(Woo Young is exhausted.)

1718
01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:55.653
Hey, that was so scary.

1719
01:05:55.653 --> 01:05:58.423
Gosh, I felt as if I was watching a horror movie.

1720
01:05:58.653 --> 01:06:00.892
Hey, wait. Hang on.

1721
01:06:01.762 --> 01:06:02.963
(Falling)

1722
01:06:03.963 --> 01:06:05.832
(After knocking Cheetah down, )

1723
01:06:05.832 --> 01:06:07.463
(he finally gets his revenge.)

1724
01:06:08.503 --> 01:06:10.903
But I'm serious. Look at this.

1725
01:06:11.872 --> 01:06:14.242
Stop it already. No more clams!

1726
01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:15.702
Enough!

1727
01:06:15.702 --> 01:06:16.742
It's gigantic!

1728
01:06:16.742 --> 01:06:18.713
We can buy them over there!

1729
01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:21.713
We just washed up, and the sun has already set.

1730
01:06:21.742 --> 01:06:22.742
I know, right?

1731
01:06:23.182 --> 01:06:25.182
- I had so much fun. - Me too.

1732
01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.582
- Seriously. - It was awesome.

1733
01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.282
I learned how fun impromptu trips can be.

1734
01:06:29.282 --> 01:06:31.153
We got fixated on Eurwangni and just left.

1735
01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:32.293
Eurwangni is awesome.

1736
01:06:32.293 --> 01:06:33.923
- Eurwangni. - Eurwangni.

1737
01:06:34.823 --> 01:06:36.062
What is that?

1738
01:06:36.122 --> 01:06:37.593
- What... - Hold on.

1739
01:06:38.293 --> 01:06:40.503
(It's a huge pot of braised seafood!)

1740
01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:41.963
(He's choking.)

1741
01:06:41.963 --> 01:06:43.832
We didn't catch these things.

1742
01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.003
- What you caught is underneath. - Oh, I see.

1743
01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.202
Thank you.

1744
01:06:47.843 --> 01:06:49.273
I should take a picture of it.

1745
01:06:49.543 --> 01:06:50.713
They're alive.

1746
01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:52.242
No, they're not...

1747
01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:54.113
- Look, they're alive. - They're still alive.

1748
01:06:54.182 --> 01:06:55.242
My gosh, this is...

1749
01:06:55.242 --> 01:06:57.613
Amazing. This is incredible.

1750
01:06:57.952 --> 01:07:00.082
- Eat up. - I'll definitely enjoy this.

1751
01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:02.253
Thank you for the food. I hope you guys enjoy it too.

1752
01:07:03.023 --> 01:07:04.193
(Eating)

1753
01:07:05.352 --> 01:07:07.222
(Enjoying)

1754
01:07:07.222 --> 01:07:08.392
Oh, this clam...

1755
01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.832
This is like a work of art.

1756
01:07:10.832 --> 01:07:12.363
- It really is. - It's amazing.

1757
01:07:13.432 --> 01:07:14.463
(He bit his tongue.)

1758
01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.003
This is delicious.

1759
01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.202
- We caught those. - Yes, our clams.

1760
01:07:21.202 --> 01:07:22.872
- We caught them. - Do you know what they're called?

1761
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.372
- No. - Sanghap.

1762
01:07:24.512 --> 01:07:25.773
- Sanghap? - Yes.

1763
01:07:25.912 --> 01:07:28.113
- It's the most expensive clam. - Oh, really?

1764
01:07:28.113 --> 01:07:29.383
- The big one, right? - Yes.

1765
01:07:29.383 --> 01:07:30.782
- Sangam? - Sanghap.

1766
01:07:30.782 --> 01:07:31.852
- Sanghap. - Sanghap?

1767
01:07:31.852 --> 01:07:33.053
Sangam is the name of...

1768
01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:34.753
- Sangam-dong? - Sangam is... Yes.

1769
01:07:34.753 --> 01:07:36.582
- The World Cup Stadium. - You should each take one.

1770
01:07:36.823 --> 01:07:38.193
Here's the lobster.

1771
01:07:38.193 --> 01:07:40.423
- The lobster is here. - Right, we ordered that too.

1772
01:07:40.492 --> 01:07:41.593
- What? - Oh, my.

1773
01:07:41.593 --> 01:07:43.463
Wow, that one is... Right?

1774
01:07:43.463 --> 01:07:45.463
- Shall I bring another table? - We probably should.

- It has to be cut. - You have to cut it.

1778
01:07:52.532 --> 01:07:53.702
Just wait a bit.

1779

(I want to eat it now.)

1780
01:07:56.242 --> 01:07:59.043
Honestly, there's so much food. There are too many things to eat.

1781
01:07:59.372 --> 01:08:00.543
It looks delicious.

1782
01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.912
Let's not think about anything else and just focus on eating now.

I feel like we're really friends now.

1799
01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:50.463
We paid rent...

1800
01:08:50.463 --> 01:08:52.763
and stayed at her place for a couple of days,

1801
01:08:52.763 --> 01:08:55.933
but she makes me feel as comfortable as Chan Sung does.

1802
01:08:55.933 --> 01:08:59.032
I think the three of us can become best friends.

1803
01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:01.942
I thought, "Can living with someone be this fun?"

1804

They definitely enlivened my mundane life.

1807
01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:16.992
Spending time with them was like an amazing gift.

1808
