00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:09.827
(The cameras for video chat are being connected one by one.)

2
00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:15.427
(Members begin to gather in front of their cameras.)

3
00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:17.337
All right.

4
00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:18.867
(Let me see.)

5
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.707
(Is this it?)

6
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.907
(Sae Ho is connected.)

7
00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:25.277
(Se Hyeong is connected.)

8
00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:26.346
(Hello!)

9
00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.659
- Se Hyeong. - Hi. Can you hear my voice?

10
00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.299
Yes, yes. I can hear you. Can you hear me?

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.600
- Hey, Jun Ha! - It worked.

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.829
- Hello, Jun Ha. - Hey, Se Hyeong.

13
00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.030
- Hi. - My gosh.

14
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.969
- Hello. This is so interesting. - Goodness.

15
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.439
- Hello, Myeong Soo. - Hey.

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.640
- Hi. - Hello.

17
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.210
(It's nice to see you.)

18
00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.939
- My gosh, it's nice to see you all. - Goodness.

19
00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:44.310
(One by one, members join the video chat.)

20
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.310
- Haha! - Have you been well?

21
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.210
- Haha! - It's great to see you all!

22
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.420
Are you serious? That's so last season.

23
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.750
What's going on? Why isn't Jae Seok online?

24
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.820
What is this? Isn't this working?

25
00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.690
Sae Ho, what's the picture behind you?

26
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.359
That photo? That's a photo of myself.

27
00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.729
Isn't that a mug shot?

28
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.999
No, it's not.

29
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.369
It's just my photo.

30
00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.470
But it looks like you're shirtless in the photo.

31
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.600
Yes, I'm shirtless.

32
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.800
Did you take it at a bathhouse?

33
00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.609
No, I took it at a photo studio.

34
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:14.940
- Hey, Jae Seok! - Jae Seok!

35
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.080
- I'm in now. - Good for you!

36
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.080
Hello.

37
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.279
- Where are you now, Jae Seok? - Gosh.

38
00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:19.609
I'm at home.

39
00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:24.979
I feel like other users are watching my online show.

40
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.490
"Users"? My gosh, that's such an old term!

41
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.990
Sae Ho, why are you wearing a suit?

42
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.790
Why is he in a suit at home?

43
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.999
Anyway, is this how we are going to do the opening segment?

44
00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.999
- My gosh. - Don't do that.

45
00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.669
- What are you doing? - Come on.

46
00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:43.139
Hey, you ought to wear something entertaining as these pants!

47
00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.800
- Are you two serious? - My gosh.

48
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.910
They definitely prepared that.

49
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.240
Dear me. What's up with these two?

50
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.080
- Hey, you. - Cook ramyeon, and eat.

51
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.740
We ought to show the viewers how we eat ramyeon.

52
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.380
Should I do that? Do you want me to eat ramyeon?

53
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.580
- Wait for a moment. - Let's see who makes tastiest one.

54
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.820
- I'll show the highlight of this. - We're cooking all of a sudden?

55
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.850
Hold on.

56
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.949
- I'll cook the best ramyeon. - Are we doing this?

57
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.589
- Hold on. - Why are we cooking ramyeon?

58
00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.820
Are we cooking ramyeon now?

59
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.429
Okay, fine. I'll cook it then.

60
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.160
My gosh. Should I at least peel an apple?

61
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.470
Where did they all go? Where are they?

62
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.329
Where did everyone go?

63
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.000
They went to cook. Okay. wait. I'll be back.

64
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.639
(Empty)

65
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.810
What? Where are they?

66
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.479
What happened? No one is here.

67
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.220
Everyone really went to cook ramyeon.

68
00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.090
I'm done cooking.

69
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.220
I'm done.

70
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.389
(Sae Ho comes back online with ramyeon.)

71
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.690
(Steaming)

72
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.400
What? You're already done cooking?

73
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.060
- I can't cook, so here's an apple. - Yes, I cooked it.

74
00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.429
How could you cook it so quickly? Wait. Let's eat it together.

75
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.699
(Slurping)

76
00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.940
My gosh, you make it look so delicious. You're good at this.

77
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:54.509
(Sucking in)

78
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.910
(Feeling proud)

79
00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.549
My laptop. The soup splattered all over my laptop. This is bad.

80
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.720
(Meanwhile, Haha and Jae Seok finish cooking ramyeon too.)

81
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720
- Jae Seok. - Where did you all go?

82
00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.919
They went to make ramyeon. I finished cooking.

83
00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.590
Se Hyeong, are you eating now?

84
00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.859
(Put a piece of dried laver on top of ramyeon.)

85
00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.799
(Wrap the noodles with the dried laver.)

86
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.799
Se Hyeong.

87
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.699
Why are you eating with dried laver?

88
00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.769
Actually, ramyeon is good with dried lavers.

89
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.769
Yes, it's good.

90
00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.040
(It's the tastiest!)

91
00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.340
I added dried pollack and Cheongyang chili pepper.

92
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.049
I'll eat it with kimchi like this.

93
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.780
(Gorging on ramyeon)

94
00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.579
(He's stuffing his face with ramyeon.)

95
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.250
(Blowing)

96
00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.660
I'll eat it like Ha Jung Woo.

97
00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:47.989
(He can't get enough of ramyeon.)

98
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.500
(The best part of ramyeon is drinking the soup.)

99
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.429
(By the way, one member still hasn't come back.)

100
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.769
(I'm done.)

101
00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.239
Gosh, it was good.

102
00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.910
(They finish eating ramyeon.)

103
00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.209
What? What's happening?

104
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.910
(Puzzled)

105
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.179
Wait. Are you guys all done?

106
00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.879
- Of course. - We finished eating.

107
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.590
- We are done. - I just brought mine.

108
00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.619
- I finished mine. - Eat by yourself.

109
00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.020
We're sorry, but we're already done.

110
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.020
Even so. Take a look at mine.

111
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.989
- I worked hard to cook this. - My gosh, what's that?

112
00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:24.229
Finish it within 30 seconds.

113
00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:27.929
But jjajang ramyeon at night is really delicious.

114
00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:28.999
It actually looks delicious.

115
00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.200
Gosh, that looks really good.

116
00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:32.939
(I am...)

117
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.410
(the original foodie on TV.)

118
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.879
(He finishes it in four bites.)

119
00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:38.309
(Amazing!)

120
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:39.950
By the way, what are we doing today?

121
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.710
Yes, what are we doing today?

122
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.580
He wasn't online.

123
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:44.979
- He's here. - Hello!

124
00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.020
- That's Tae Ho. Look at his hair. - He dyed his hair!

125
00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.419
- What happened? - Hello.

126
00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.090
- He looks like the guy in AKMU. - What's up with him?

127
00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.460
Isn't he in AKMU?

128
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.760
(Make no mistake. They are two different people.)

129
00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:56.299
- I look like Andy Warhol. - You look like Jet Li.

130
00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.470
Why are we video chatting?

131
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.499
- The cold wave hit Korea. - I see. Because it's cold?

132
00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:04.999
So you'll be working from home.

133
00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.010
I thought we could do our opening segment like this.

134
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.210
Were you trying to look out for us?

135
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.739
- We won't be shooting now. - Thank you.

136
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.010
We are going to randomly visit each member starting tomorrow.

137
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.020
(They plan to make surprise visits.)

138
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.650
This week's special is An Hour Before.

139
00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.489
In the other episode, Myeong Soo claimed that...

140
00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.429
confidence is more important than effort.

141
00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:26.489
- Yes, I did. - Right.

142
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.330
So we're doing a special where only your confidence matters.

143
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.729
- Regardless of your place... - What?

144
00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:33.900
and situation,

145
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.999
you will be placed under a situation an hour before the task.

146
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.669
We are going to check if you can adapt to any given circumstances...

147
00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.809
- and carry out your task. - That was Myeong Soo's claim.

148
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:44.379
- We didn't say that. - Exactly!

149
00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.109
Why are you holding us responsible for that?

150
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.049
We can stop a war within an hour. What are you talking about?

151
00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:50.479
They were generous to give us an hour.

152
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.520
Then we'll only have an hour before whatever the task we get.

153
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.020
- Send Myeong Soo back to the army. - Yes, let's do that.

154
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.689
He ought to do a march.

155
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.929
Victory! Yes, I can! I can totally go back.

156
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.169
I want Se Hyeong to teach middle schoolers Korean history.

157
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.999
(He gets the chills.)

158
00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:09.040
He won't be able to teach.

159
00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.799
Sing at the birthday parties.

160
00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.410
Haha should go to the parties and do the juggling tricks.

161
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.580
Sleep tight.

162
00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:19.410
- I'll see you all soon. - Are you serious?

163
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.879
My goodness!

164
00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:22.979
(Feeling lost)

165
00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.720
Okay. Everyone, bye.

166
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.689
- Bye, bye! - Come on.

167
00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.859
- We don't use that anymore. - I love you all.

168
00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.260
- Bye. - Goodbye.

169
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.799
(They'll be put in a situation with no information an hour earlier.)

170
00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.030
(The task will be revealed an hour before it happens.)

171
00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.799
(Whatever unfolds before their eyes,)

172
00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.200
(they cannot be thrown back and must adapt to the situation.)

173
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.109
(They are given only 1 hour.)

174
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.309
(1 Hour Before)

175
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.010
- Can I do this? - Yes.

176
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.319
(They gather again a few days later.)

177
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.780
- I'm sitting next to you today. - Sure, sure.

178
00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:00.790
What must I do to get that spot?

179
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.319
My gosh, I don't feel comfortable sitting next to him.

180
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.359
Goodness, being the second host today is nerve-wracking.

181
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.129
- I'll start now. - Okay.

182
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.390
Viewers,

183
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.299
- Hello. This is Infinite... - Hello.

184
00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:11.530
- Challenge! - Challenge!

185
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.229
- We did our opening segment... - Right.

186
00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:16.799
- through the video chat. - It was lovely.

187
00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:17.799
- It was, wasn't it? - Yes, it was.

188
00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:19.609
- We ate ramyeon during the chat. - Right.

189
00:07:19.609 --> 00:07:20.939
It's been a while since I had...

190
00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:22.410
- such tasty ramyeon. - It's because...

191
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.609
all of us ate at the same time. It felt like we were having a meal.

192
00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:26.379
Now, I can understand why...

193
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.150
- people watch others eat. - I agree.

194
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.819
- I had to eat ramyeon that day. - Jjajangmyeon was really good.

195
00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.150
- Right. Gosh. - I really wanted to eat yours.

196
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.460
But you guys can't wipe off the signs of being old men.

197
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.020
You didn't know that you could also chat by typing too, right?

198
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.359
- No one knew, right? - What? Where was that?

199
00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:43.660
- Did you type in something? - I typed, but no one saw it.

200
00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:45.700
- I was the only one typing. - Where was it though?

201
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.999
- It was on the lower left corner. - I did see the screen for that.

202
00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:50.299
- Se Hyeong is certainly tech-savvy. - I didn't see that.

203
00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:51.900
- At this point... - What are you talking about?

204
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.970
(That's nonsense.)

205
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.710
- You're an early adopter, you know? - No, he's not.

206
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.010
- Early adoptern. - No, it's not.

207
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.040
(Of course, I know.)

208
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.080
- "Early adoptern"? - Do you not know?

209
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.010
(Something is off.)

210
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.580
- Do you know the term or not? - "Early adoptern"?

211
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.950
What does that mean?

212
00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:05.489
- What does that mean? - Doesn't it mean I'm an expert?

213
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.419
My gosh, it refers to people who know...

214
00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:10.059
- He's charming in his own way. - their way around electronics.

215
00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:11.660
And they're the first people to use the newest gadgets.

216
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.489
Well, that term doesn't really play a big role in my life.

217
00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:16.229
I only memorize things that are integral in my life.

218
00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.999
- His ego is slightly bruised. - I know.

219
00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.700
- He seems slightly hurt. - No, no. Not at all.

220
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.770
Not at all.

221
00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:26.609
Anyway, I wondered what "An Hour Before" meant.

222
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:29.780
- They told me nothing on the way. - Right, right.

223
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.939
They didn't even answer my questions. It was so frustrating.

224
00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:34.250
It was hard to stay there by myself.

225
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.079
Let's find out where we all went.

226
00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:38.819
- We'll check out the clips now. - Okay.

227
00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:40.549
Let's take a look at the VCR!

228
00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.589
We don't use video cassette recorders now.

229
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.089
(The next day morning, at Jae Seok's house)

230
00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:48.530
- Wait, this is... - Yes, it's my house.

231
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.599
(The staff members give him a surprise visit.)

232
00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:51.699
- I didn't know anything then. - Hello.

233
00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:52.699
Hello.

234
00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:54.000
Did you have a good night's sleep?

235
00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:56.740
I wouldn't call it that. I just slept for a few hours.

236
00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.410
You are heading somewhere now.

237
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.469
Where?

238
00:09:00.469 --> 00:09:03.740
You can get on the van and find out once you get there.

239
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.049
Why are you not telling me where I'm going?

240
00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:08.819
- First off... - I only know I have an hour.

241
00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.120
No one will know.

242
00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:12.049
Which one? Do I get on that one?

243
00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:13.290
- Yes. - Okay.

244
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.520
(They've covered the windows.)

245
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520
What is this?

246
00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:19.030
(Before he knows it, the door is shut.)

247
00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:21.059
What's going on?

248
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.360
(In an instant, Jae Seok is taken.)

249
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.799
- My gosh, where are we going? - Even the driver didn't talk much.

250
00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:28.000
Excuse me. Is anyone there? Sir?

251
00:09:28.099 --> 00:09:29.469
I'm the only one here.

252
00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:33.339
Sir, where are we headed?

253
00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:35.240
I'm just driving to a place they told me to go.

254
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.480
So where is that place?

255
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.579
I'm just following the instruction.

256
00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:44.020
Wait. Please don't answer my questions like you're an AI.

257
00:09:44.219 --> 00:09:46.390
Please give me some hints, sir.

258
00:09:46.849 --> 00:09:47.990
I'm in the dark as much as you.

259
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.919
This is driving me crazy.

260
00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:54.790
(The day the cold wave hit, at Sae Ho's house)

261
00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:56.599
I started really early in the morning.

262
00:09:56.599 --> 00:09:58.329
- I started around 5am. - Hello.

263
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.669
Is this the car? Infinite Challenge!

264
00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:02.969
I always wanted to do this.

265
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.000
(Feeling embarrassed)

266
00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:06.709
Is it this van?

267
00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:08.679
- Please get on the van. - Should I do that?

268
00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.150
What?

269
00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.780
- What is this? - The windows were covered well.

270
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.980
I couldn't see anything.

271
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.449
It was so dark...

272
00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:19.150
that I thought someone was already in the van.

273
00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:22.260
What is this?

274
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.160
This is incredible. The van is moving.

275
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.589
Where am I going?

276
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.160
Sir, where are we going?

277
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.299
This is driving me crazy.

278
00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:33.569
(His driver exercises his right to remain silent.)

279
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.169
This is scary. No one is here.

280
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.270
(He loses his mind.)

281
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.339
What is going on?

282
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.280
- Hello. - It's so early in the morning.

283
00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:48.579
- What is going on? - Where am I going?

284
00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:50.679
- Please get on the van. - They came out of their houses.

285
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.520
Will I find people in black suits inside?

286
00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:57.819
What is this? Gosh, that startled me.

287
00:10:57.819 --> 00:10:59.530
Please don't do things like this.

288
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.230
What is this? Is someone inside?

289
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.400
Jae Seok is inside, right? Jae Seok.

290
00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:06.130
(He is inside a different van.)

291
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.429
Sir, please tell me this. Will it take long to reach there?

292
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.540
I don't know.

293
00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:12.669
(He is still struggling with the AI.)

294
00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:13.709
It's moving.

295
00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:15.040
Where am I going?

296
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.480
Gosh, I am so curious.

297
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.449
(He gives up quickly and deeply falls asleep.)

298
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.679
Where am I going at 5:30am?

299
00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.650
There is no one to ask.

300
00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:27.419
- Are the members moving separately? - There is no one.

301
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:28.719
They covered the windows thoroughly.

302
00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:30.120
(The beginning of the mission approaches.)

303
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.290
This is driving me crazy.

304
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.490
This is driving me crazy.

305
00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.160
(1 Hour Before)

306
00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:39.199
- What is this? - I think it's Haha's van.

307
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.370
I think that's my van.

308
00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:43.400
(Where am I going?)

309
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:45.199
This is suffocating.

310
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.610
This is suffocating.

311
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.569
It's suffocating to have no one to talk to.

312
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.679
(He gives up quickly.)

313
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:54.579
(He falls asleep.)

314
00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:56.650
(Meanwhile, the van leaves Seoul.)

315
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.380
- Where is it going? - It's going far.

316
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.790
It went very far.

317
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.819
I slept well.

318
00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:04.589
(He sleeps well thanks to his small stature.)

319
00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:09.230
(The van crosses the mountain and river.)

320
00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.099
(He arrives at a mysterious place.)

321
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.900
Haha, you have arrived.

322
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.370
(Startled)

323
00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:21.069
If you put on a blindfold in front,

324
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:22.480
we will guide you.

325
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.839
Hold on.

326
00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:28.010
(A headset that plays music and a blindfold)

327
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.520
(He goes out with his eyes and ears covered.)

328
00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:36.160
(He walks carefully with the staff's help.)

329
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.020
I can't see anything. Hold on.

330
00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:40.689
(Holding hands)

331
00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:43.660
You copied Oh Hyuk's style.

332
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.370
- I was Oh Hyuk that day. - You were, right?

333
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.770
- You were helped like a grandpa. - I could hear babies.

334
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.370
What is this?

335
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.870
(He becomes suspicious of the stairs.)

336
00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:57.910
What could this be? It's driving me crazy.

337
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.750
This is driving me crazy.

338
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.679
(The grandpa is full of worries.)

339
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.780
Are there more stairs?

340
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.490
(He holds onto his grandson and moves forward.)

341
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.959
Why do I look so sick?

342
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.199
- What's wrong with him? - I look sick.

343
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:19.929
It's all about confidence.

344
00:13:20.469 --> 00:13:22.400
Like Myeong Soo said, it's all about confidence.

345
00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:23.770
I will win.

346
00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:25.610
Are we going?

347
00:13:26.169 --> 00:13:27.209
Is the ground flat?

348
00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:29.110
(He walks into a mysterious building.)

349
00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:32.110
Is the ground flat?

350
00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:33.880
(The room is quiet.)

351
00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:36.150
I smell food.

352
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.549
(Sniffing)

353
00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:41.589
(He gets dragged away.)

354
00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:42.790
I smell jeon. Am I wrong?

355
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.919
(He makes guesses with his nose.)

356
00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:47.030
(Where is he?)

357
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.130
What is going on?

358
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.760
(The headset is removed first.)

359
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.169
(What is going on?)

360
00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:56.740
Please remove your blindfold.

361
00:13:59.469 --> 00:14:02.140
(Haha finally removes his blindfold.)

362
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.939
(What is the situation in front of him?)

363
00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:07.849
(My goodness.)

364
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.579
- Please give him a big hand. - No way. Did that really happen?

365
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.620
No way.

366
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.290
- I had no idea. - This isn't an hour before.

367
00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.559
I was so surprised.

368
00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.660
Please take good care of him.

369
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.329
Look behind you.

370
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:22.630
(Is there anyone behind me?)

371
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.569
Haha from Infinite Challenge came.

372
00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:29.040
(He bows awkwardly.)

373
00:14:29.439 --> 00:14:32.110
Only the oldest daughter knew. The rest of the family didn't.

374
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.839
She applied for this, right?

375
00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:38.439
(Haha. Haha.)

376
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.709
Hello, ma'am.

377
00:14:39.709 --> 00:14:40.910
(He bows first.)

378
00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:42.919
Is it your birthday?

379
00:14:43.219 --> 00:14:45.390
When I turned around, I saw the signs in Chinese letters.

380
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.949
I couldn't read them.

381
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:48.049
"The 70th birthday party".

382
00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:50.490
It's her 70th birthday party.

383
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.520
My goodness.

384
00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:54.790
(A few weeks ago, the production crew found out...)

385
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.760
(that Haha hosted a birthday party.)

386
00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.230
What are you talking about?

387
00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:02.370
(It was further reported that Haha rides a unicycle and juggles.)

388
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.270
I will really go.

389
00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.169
I will really go to a birthday party.

390
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.439
(Is he here to give a performance?)

391
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.309
Where am I?

392
00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:11.339
- Chuncheon. - Chuncheon?

393
00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:12.510
He went all the way to Chuncheon.

394
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.980
- You had no idea where you were at. - I had no idea.

395
00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:18.620
Haha, it's an hour before your performance to celebrate...

396
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.790
Ms. Hong Young Ja's 70th birthday party.

397
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.819
(It's an hour before.)

398
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.459
This is hilarious.

399
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.589
(A performance for the 70th birthday party)

400
00:15:26.589 --> 00:15:29.199
(1 Hour before)

401
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:31.429
My goodness.

402
00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.000
She is looking forward to it.

403
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.500
(What should I do?)

404
00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:41.870
Please give him a big hand again.

405
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.110
Don't look at me.

406
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.939
It's so embarrassing.

407
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.049
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

408
00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:49.349
Please cheer for him.

409
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.349
What is this?

410
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.589
What is this?

411
00:15:55.819 --> 00:15:57.689
(He is under a lot of pressure.)

412
00:15:58.189 --> 00:16:00.589
How am I supposed to give a performance by myself?

413
00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:02.500
For goodness' sake.

414
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.000
(He collapses.)

415
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.500
- I was under a lot of pressure. - That's...

416
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.640
It's a celebration that will become a special memory of her life.

417
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.439
- That's right. - If Haha doesn't do well,

418
00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:13.770
- people will remember. - He needs to do well.

419
00:16:14.209 --> 00:16:15.809
(His feet are heavy due to pressure.)

420
00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:18.040
Her grandson will play the clarinet,

421
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.110
so there will be a competition.

422
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.049
(Laughing)

423
00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:24.280
I mean...

424
00:16:24.349 --> 00:16:27.290
I have never given a performance at a birthday party.

425
00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.919
For goodness' sake.

426
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.160
I can't ride this.

427
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.230
For goodness' sake.

428
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.799
(A unicycle for his performance)

429
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.099
(Juggling balls and balloons)

430
00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:41.099
This is too much.

431
00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:43.169
I can't believe it.

432
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.669
(Sighing)

433
00:16:45.969 --> 00:16:47.040
(He gets on the unicycle.)

434
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.540
There is no brake.

435
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.209
(Struggling)

436
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.250
(Shaking)

437
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.980
What's wrong with my face?

438
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.449
You are so ugly.

439
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:58.219
- What's wrong with it? - What's wrong with your face?

440
00:16:58.219 --> 00:16:59.319
(He struggles with a unicycle.)

441
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.359
(I am doomed.)

442
00:17:02.359 --> 00:17:04.319
I have never given a performance at a birthday party.

443
00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:08.799
(The 70th birthday party begins at the hall.)

444
00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:11.129
Happy birthday to you

445
00:17:11.129 --> 00:17:13.500
- The atmosphere is serene... - Yes. It's calm.

446
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.270
and reverent.

447
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.139
For goodness' sake!

448
00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:20.470
Give me someone.

449
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.909
Why don't you call and see if anyone is around?

450
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.109
I don't know anyone in Chuncheon!

451
00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.309
How about Skull?

452
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:28.510
Hey!

453
00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:32.049
(He makes an SOS call to his best friend, Skull.)

454
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:34.190
This is driving me crazy.

455
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.319
- Hello. - You picked up. Hello.

456
00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:37.760
- Hello. - Where are you?

457
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.629
I am on my way to Busan in a train.

458
00:17:40.629 --> 00:17:42.159
- Busan? - Yes.

459
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.530
(No.)

460
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.799
(Ms. Hong Young Ja reads her letter this time.)

461
00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:56.710
(The heartwarming mood fills the room.)

462
00:17:58.609 --> 00:17:59.649
(He doesn't know what to do.)

463
00:17:59.649 --> 00:18:01.049
What should I do?

464
00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:03.049
Hold on. Should I sing "Love" by Na Hoon A?

465
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:04.180
Which song should I sing?

466
00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:06.190
Let's pick a song first.

467
00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:08.149
I will definitely sing a song.

468
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.190
Which song should I sing? Which song do I know?

469
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.930
What's her name?

470
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.030
- Ms. Hong Young Ja. - Ms. Hong Young Ja.

471
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.659
Young Ja

472
00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:18.299
My love, Young Ja

473
00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:21.000
Young Ja, Young Ja, Young Ja

474
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.540
(What am I doing?)

475
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.869
The outfit at the back is really funny to me.

476
00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:27.369
What is this?

477
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.379
Do you want me to wear this?

478
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.180
(It's a costume specially prepared for a little man.)

479
00:18:34.879 --> 00:18:36.250
For goodness' sake!

480
00:18:36.319 --> 00:18:39.520
This is too embarrassing!

481
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.690
This isn't even funny.

482
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.619
My face will go red,

483
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.990
and my heart will pound.

484
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.700
(A calm performance will soothe his heart.)

485
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.260
That was the atmosphere.

486
00:18:51.629 --> 00:18:53.670
I had to perform in that atmosphere.

487
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.700
(Her grandchildren create a serene harmony.)

488
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.099
It's lovely.

489
00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.770
(Her grandchildren create a serene harmony.)

490
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.040
How am I supposed to do this alone?

491
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.139
This is embarrassing.

492
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.609
How am I supposed to do this alone?

493
00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:09.619
(He hangs his head.)

494
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:12.950
This is driving me crazy.

495
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.720
I am going insane.

496
00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.420
It would be better if someone teaches me the know-how.

497
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.629
I don't even have a guide.

498
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.200
There is a staff member who can do balloon art.

499
00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:24.399
Really?

500
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.369
(A staff member who knows balloon art helps him.)

501
00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:30.099
(He teaches Haha how to make a balloon animal.)

502
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.270
My goodness.

503
00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:33.309
It's a flower, right?

504
00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:35.069
It's a dog.

505
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.639
Do you know how to make a flower?

506
00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:38.280
(You can't make a dog at a birthday party.)

507
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.450
I can only make a dog.

508
00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:43.049
Is it because it's the year of the dog?

509
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.180
You can only make a dog.

510
00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:49.290
For Ms. Hong Young Ja...

511
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.420
(Working hard)

512
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.960
(He is determined to make her a pretty balloon.)

513
00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:56.329
My goodness.

514
00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.599
It was hard to tie it.

515
00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:58.869
It takes skills.

516
00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:00.329
I don't even have long nails.

517
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.569
(He struggles to make a balloon when he has no time.)

518
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.970
I won't do it!

519
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.040
(He explodes.)

520
00:20:07.409 --> 00:20:09.210
(I'm done for.)

521
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.950
Tae Ho!

522
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.720
How can I do this all by myself?

523
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.649
(They're singing together here.)

524
00:20:19.649 --> 00:20:21.450
It's a very reverent party.

525
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.629
(They are all singing the song "Mother's Kindness" together.)

526
00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:31.500
(Let's try this again.)

527
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.829
(Sucking up air)

528
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.500
(He's learning to blow balloons so that he can do more things.)

529
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:43.740
(The 70th birthday party is becoming more exciting...)

530
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.549
(with the grandchildren singing musical numbers.)

531
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.420
Hello, this is Haha. Welcome to Ms. Hong's...

532
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.950
(He even changed his clothes for practice.)

533
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.920
When she tells me what she likes...

534
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.490
(Crying)

535
00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:01.790
(Where am I? What am I doing?)

536
00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:04.700
(It's dance time.)

537
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.599
(Adorable)

538
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.839
(Thanks to the family members who are so talented...)

539
00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:14.609
They are all good at singing.

540
00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:18.280
(The audience are getting more excited.)

541
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.020
(5 minutes before the 70th birthday show)

542
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.549
I feel more nervous than I was before the music festival.

543
00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:26.720
I'm not sure if I should say this,

544
00:21:27.089 --> 00:21:29.220
but I'm in love with someone.

545
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.889
(Haha is doing his best to prepare until the last minute.)

546
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.470
(With Ms. Hong's song,)

547
00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:45.240
(the prearranged main events are over.)

548
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.940
I just need to show that I'm sincere.

549
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.579
(It's time for Haha's special show.)

550
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.579
I nearly died there.

551
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.950
I really wanted to run away.

552
00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:01.690
Haha is ready now.

553
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.119
He's ready for his show.

554
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.960
- Please give him a big hand. - I'll go in now.

555
00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:11.329
(It's Ms. Hong's one and only 70th birthday party.)

556
00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:14.599
(He needs to entertain her in every possible way.)

557
00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:19.339
(The special 70th birthday party show starts!)

558
00:22:21.809 --> 00:22:24.240
He brought the unicycle with him.

559
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.609
There was nothing much for me to lean on.

560
00:22:26.609 --> 00:22:28.609
The unicycle was like Skull to me.

561
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.480
I'd like to officially introduce myself.

562
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.849
I'm Haha,

563
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.960
and I've come here to celebrate the 70th birthday...

564
00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:40.030
of Chuncheon's goddess, Chuncheon's Seol Hyun,

565
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.960
Ms. Hong Young Ja. Nice to meet you!

566
00:22:44.829 --> 00:22:46.799
Make some noise!

567
00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:49.500
Your lines are...

568
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.869
We need to practice something. It's not that difficult.

569
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:54.069
Young Ja

570
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.139
(He arranged his own song, "Rosa", into a new song, "Young Ja".)

571
00:22:56.139 --> 00:22:57.780
When I hand you over the microphone...

572
00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:01.649
(He's going to make them chant Ms. Hong's name.)

573
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:03.149
Let's go!

574
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.490
Ms. Hong, happy birthday.

575
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.960
- Thank you. - MR volume up.

576
00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:13.260
Put your hands up in the air!

577
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.159
(Are you in your right mind?)

578
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.099
Turn off the TV! I'll give you money.

579
00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:19.629
I'll pay you. Turn it off.

580
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.940
- How much are you giving? - I'll give you the money!

581
00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.700
Put your hands in the air.

582
00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:27.010
Chuncheon, let's put out hands up in the sky.

583
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.740
- Don't do this to me. - I can't watch.

584
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.980
Why are you asking Ms. Hong to put her hands up?

585
00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:34.379
(He starts excitedly after telling them to put their hands up.)

586
00:23:34.609 --> 00:23:35.920
Say Young Ja!

587
00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:39.190
- Young Ja, Young Ja, Young Ja. - I'll do whatever you say!

588
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.220
- Young Ja, Young Ja, Young Ja. - Turn it off now! Please!

589
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.230
(Chanting Young Ja has made everyone excited.)

590
00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:48.329
(Young Ja, Young Ja)

591
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.329
(It's as if he's in a housewife singing class.)

592
00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:51.460
Come on.

593
00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:55.299
(I want to have curry today)

594
00:23:55.299 --> 00:23:56.740
(What?)

595
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.270
(He doesn't know what to do with his hands.)

596
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.409
(The reggae beat is difficult to follow.)

597
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.980
Please turn this video off!

598
00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:08.549
(He's using his husky reggae voice to change the mood.)

599
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.349
(But they can't get used to its beat.)

600
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:15.760
(They are losing interest.)

601
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.790
(Following)

602
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.059
(Dancing)

603
00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:23.629
Thank you, kids. Thank you.

604
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.629
(He's suddenly overcome with shame.)

605
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.299
(The mood has changed.)

606
00:24:29.299 --> 00:24:30.740
(She's happy too.)

607
00:24:31.799 --> 00:24:33.770
(He gained confidence thanks to them.)

608
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.839
Say "Young Ja". Follow me.

609
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.879
(He's in a trance.)

610
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.079
(Chuckling)

611
00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:46.049
I'm going to this table now.

612
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.720
(My love, Young Ja.)

613
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.420
(Dancing)

614
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.930
(They're changing reggae beat to Jajinmori tempo.)

615
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.430
Stand up, everyone.

616
00:24:56.659 --> 00:24:58.730
I'm not going to watch this anymore.

617
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.069
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

618
00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:04.670
(They're all dancing together like a windscreen wiper.)

619
00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:06.809
Come on, everyone!

620
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.609
Thank you.

621
00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:10.480
(The "Young Ja" performance was successful.)

622
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.579
If you'd like to congratulate Ms. Hong on her 70th birthday...

623
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:16.980
(His voice is hoarse.)

624
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.579
(Glancing)

625
00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:19.589
(Yes.)

626
00:25:19.589 --> 00:25:22.559
Make some noise!

627
00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:24.290
(Before he starts, he lifts up the mood.)

628
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.799
(He makes a show of balloon blowing while flapping his coat.)

629
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.899
(He makes a dog out of a balloon which he learned an hour ago.)

630
00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:34.829
(Hitting him in the face)

631
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.770
(Begging for response)

632
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.040
(They're scared that the balloon might burst.)

633
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.210
(Concentrating)

634
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.780
(He barely manages to make one after squeezing it like laundry.)

635
00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:49.819
I'd like to give you this pink dog.

636
00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:51.720
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

637
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.049
(Hugging)

638
00:25:53.349 --> 00:25:54.549
Give her a big hand.

639
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:56.359
(If it gets a little quiet, he tries his best to lift up the mood.)

640
00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:57.859
Happy birthday.

641
00:25:58.159 --> 00:25:59.530
Happy birthday, ma'am.

642
00:25:59.589 --> 00:26:00.889
Thank you.

643
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.230
(She shyly takes a photo.)

644
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.430
(Laughing)

645
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.230
Is that what her face expression was like?

646
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.510
I'd like to congratulate you. There's one last thing I prepared.

647
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.339
(He's the celebrity that said he'd never go to birthday parties.)

648
00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:18.280
If I can come here again 10 years later,

649
00:26:18.579 --> 00:26:20.849
I'd come celebrate your 80th birthday party.

650
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.520
(He sings Na Hoon A's "Love" as his final performance.)

651
00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:29.059
(His voice is as thick as makgeolli.)

652
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.559
(Standing up)

653
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:34.329
I can't do this one.

654
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.599
(To continue the good mood, he dances with her.)

655
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.129
You can take photos.

656
00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:39.700
(He's smooth.)

657
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.299
- You look great. - Yes.

658
00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:44.440
(Smiling)

659
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.839
(They take pictures of this special fan service.)

660
00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:52.079
(They cheer for him passionately with their little hands.)

661
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.950
(Everyone's enjoying the song comfortably.)

662
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.290
Let's sing "My Young Ja" together.

663
00:27:02.089 --> 00:27:03.990
(He finishes off with a graceful chorus.)

664
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.530
Happy birthday!

665
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.190
Thank you.

666
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.460
- The ending was great. - It was.

667
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.000
That's the voice he uses...

668
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.399
to bright up the mood.

669
00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:18.740
(Screaming)

670
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.280
Balloon! Balloon!

671
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.109
- Balloons! - Balloons!

672
00:27:25.139 --> 00:27:28.280
- Balloons! - Balloons!

673
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.250
If you want dogs made out of a balloon for souvenir,

674
00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:34.589
- I'll be making more at the corner. - I want one!

675
00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:36.159
All right. I'll make you one.

676
00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:38.389
Happy birthday again, ma'am.

677
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:39.530
(She has a meaningful look.)

678
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.930
I told you, but...

679
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.000
(He exits after getting all his props.)

680
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.260
- He brought a unicycle. - Why did he bring that?

681
00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:47.730
It's like a bag to me.

682
00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.869
It's like a handbag.

683
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.540
I want one!

684
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.980
- Balloons! - Balloons!

685
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.579
(The woman gets up from her seat.)

686
00:28:02.879 --> 00:28:04.149
(Taking the microphone)

687
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.520
(She fills the stage that Haha had left.)

688
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.619
(She has flashy gestures, just like Messi's dribbles.)

689
00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:15.530
(But why are people leaving their seats?)

690
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.270
(They're heading towards Haha in the corner.)

691
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.970
(He's gotten all the attention by taking photos.)

692
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.440
(Glancing)

693
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.510
(Her soulfulness has crossed the red line.)

694
00:28:32.109 --> 00:28:34.480
(Glancing)

695
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.680
(But the audience doesn't come back.)

696
00:28:38.889 --> 00:28:40.920
(So she decides to go on a tour around the room.)

697
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.659
(She uses her special explosive singing technique.)

698
00:28:44.659 --> 00:28:46.530
She was my rival.

699
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:52.299
(They come back after she uses her special technique.)

700
00:28:54.629 --> 00:28:57.639
(She's even drawing notes with her body.)

701
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.569
(She's no joke.)

702
00:28:59.569 --> 00:29:01.809
- You're really six years old? - Yes, I am.

703
00:29:01.809 --> 00:29:03.480
You're the same age as my son.

704
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.809
I'm six too.

705
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.349
- I want one too. - You're four years old?

706
00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:10.750
No, I'm five years old.

707
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.420
Make me the same thing.

708
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.520
- White? Pink? Here. - Yes.

709
00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:18.889
- This is a gift for you. - Thank you. Thank you.

710
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.629
I'll keep this. Thank you. Happy New Year.

711
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.500
- Thank you. - Thank you.

712
00:29:23.899 --> 00:29:26.099
(Haha's special performance will be remembered by Ms. Hong too.)

713
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.309
It was meaningful.

714
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.710
It felt somehow moving.

715
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.909
It was meaningful.

716
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.710
(What is this?)

717
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.309
Happy birthday.

718
00:29:41.309 --> 00:29:42.520
(He's saying that to the wall.)

719
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.790
Yes.

720
00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.619
(It's a towel to celebrate her 70th birthday.)

721
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.619
Swagger.

722
00:29:52.889 --> 00:29:54.430
(Go Hee swagger)

723
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.299
I'll always keep this in my car.

724
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.899
Take care of yourself, Ms. Hong.

725
00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:00.869
Thank you for the special memory.

726
00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:03.569
I remember being frustrated when I had to wear this.

727
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.770
That was so meaningful. I mean it.

728
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:08.780
(He thought that was meaningful.)

729
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.480
That wasn't easy.

730
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.780
- Right. - Good work.

731
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.849
You did well.

732
00:30:13.849 --> 00:30:16.780
Mrs. Hong was so happy...

733
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.790
that you came.

734
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.049
That must have been unforgettable for her.

735
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:22.990
I wish the best for her. Congratulations again.

736
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.490
Let's continue watching the screen.

737
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.990
Start the video, Jun Ha.

738
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.659
Start the video

739
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.170
- He actually did it. - Good job.

740
00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:34.470
(Se Hyeong falls asleep.)

741
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.339
(Gimpo Airport)

742
00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:43.280
How can he fall asleep? I wasn't sleepy.

743
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.950
(It's an international flight.)

744
00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:50.149
(He looks creepy.)

745
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.089
We're here.

746
00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:55.319
Put on the blindfold and the headphones.

747
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.889
That sounds scary.

748
00:30:56.889 --> 00:30:57.889
(The reality sets into him now.)

749
00:30:58.319 --> 00:31:00.290
He's acting like that since it's about time he arrives.

750
00:31:01.129 --> 00:31:03.960
- Doesn't that suit me well? - That's your problem.

751
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.899
You're full of swag.

752
00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:07.329
Okay.

753
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.599
(He arrives at Gimpo Airport.)

754
00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:13.869
If there are stairs, please tell me.

755
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.339
If there are stairs, give me a tap.

756
00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:21.710
(He must have eyes on his hands.)

757
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.049
What's this?

758
00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:26.149
That was a bump. You should have told me.

759
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220
Too late.

760
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.119
See? You should have told me. That was dangerous.

761
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.760
- That was a bump. - He's such a coward.

762
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.670
- He's a turtle? - He's a coward.

763
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.829
I'm like that too.

764
00:31:39.829 --> 00:31:41.530
He's being dragged for so long.

765
00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:43.270
I know why you're doing that. You don't want to...

766
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.639
- bump into anything. - That's right.

767
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.210
(It's about time.)

768
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.040
What's this?

769
00:31:48.609 --> 00:31:49.609
What was that?

770
00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:51.480
(Exclaiming)

771
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.250
(He can feel objects from afar.)

772
00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.579
What's this?

773
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.220
(He's curious.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

774
00:32:05.329 --> 00:32:06.930
It's ridiculous.

775
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.799
It's true.

776
00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:11.129
- This is so real. - Right.

777
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.030
- It's ridiculous. - This is so real.

778
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.740
- It's true. - Why are we at the airport?

779
00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:19.040
- Where did you think you were? - How did you feel in the beginning?

780
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.339
I had no idea. "Why am I at the airport?"

781
00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:24.980
Did you think you were going somewhere?

782
00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.510
No, not at all. I didn't know why I was there.

783
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.720
Why are we at the airport?

784
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.420
That's a genuine reaction.

785
00:32:32.889 --> 00:32:35.149
- It's the manager. - He's the manager at the airline.

786
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:38.190
Crew member Yang Se Hyeong, we're two hours before...

787
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.359
- leaving for Ho Chi Minh City. - Where?

788
00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:41.829
- Ho Chi Minh City. - Ho Chi Minh City?

789
00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:43.430
I'll give you a dollar. Please give me a second.

790
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.369
Please hold on a moment. It'll be quick.

791
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.170
What an experience.

792
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:52.369
(2 hours before...)

793
00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:54.339
(departure to Ho Chi Minh City)

794
00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:59.079
Other members gathered an hour before,

795
00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.619
but for safety education, we got here two hours before.

796
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:07.490
What about my passport?

797
00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.690
Here it is.

798
00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.990
(No way.)

799
00:33:13.829 --> 00:33:15.829
- I thought they were still lying. - Your uniform is in the luggage.

800
00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:18.059
I thought...

801
00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:20.930
- it was a prank. - Really? I'm going to Ho Chi Minh?

802
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.569
That was unexpected.

803
00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:26.770
- Should I change? - Yes.

804
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.270
(He puts on his uniform.)

805
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.109
It feels different when you put on the uniform.

806
00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:33.780
(He's excited to work like Leonardo DiCaprio.)

807
00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:38.049
That looks good. Not so much.

808
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.149
It suits you.

809
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.750
I thought he was a kid.

810
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.420
You can try out different jobs at this center.

811
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.889
- That's right. - Hello.

812
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:47.829
- You can experience different jobs. - My son loves it.

813
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.700
(They are busy...)

814
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.829
(ensuring the safety of flights.)

815
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.639
- Should I sit here? - Yes.

816
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.069
I'm Manager Lee Yun Seok. Nice to meet you.

817
00:33:59.069 --> 00:34:00.569
- Hello. - Hello.

818
00:34:00.569 --> 00:34:02.210
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

819
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.079
Let's check the compulsory items.

820
00:34:04.079 --> 00:34:06.779
The most important is your passport. Check your own.

821
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.949
The announcement manual, crew operation manual...

822
00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.279
What are those?

823
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.050
This is the announcement manual.

824
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.219
You can read from there when you make announcements.

825
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.489
(Let's memorize this.)

826
00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.989
The red book is the crew operation manual.

827
00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.029
- Crew operation manual? - Yes.

828
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.429
This is the manual...

829
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.670
about service and safety. We checked those.

830
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.829
I'll assign your duties.

831
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:31.139
When we are on flight, we're in charge of different doors.

832
00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:35.440
Se Hyeong, you can be in charge of the back.

833
00:34:35.579 --> 00:34:37.940
- Ms. Hong... - They didn't take one person out.

834
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.009
- I was added onto the team. - Right.

835
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:41.849
All right.

836
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.980
When we are departing and landing, we sit on the jump seats...

837
00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:46.219
and do a 30-second review.

838
00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:49.159
That's when we remind ourselves of the procedures.

839
00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.190
There are turbulences in certain areas.

840
00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:53.259
There's so much English.

841
00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.300
Are you doing that on purpose or is this normal?

842
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.400
It's half-Korean and half-English.

843
00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.529
- Normally? - Yes.

844
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.670
Please summarize our flight information.

845
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:06.440
We're arriving at 1am locally. That's 3am in Incheon.

846
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.079
The flight is full, and our flight number is 8263.

847
00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:12.349
The gate number is 33.

848
00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:14.349
- Hello. - Hello.

849
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:17.449
- Hello. - Hello.

850
00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:18.690
- Let's have a debriefing. - Yes, sir.

851
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:22.520
The flight is 4703. The duration is 5 hours and 30 minutes.

852
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.360
From 2 hours and 30 minutes to 3 hours and 30 minutes,

853
00:35:26.429 --> 00:35:28.529
there will be a turbulence for an hour.

854
00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.759
- You know that beforehand? - Yes, we do.

855
00:35:30.759 --> 00:35:32.130
Good luck today.

856
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.469
Thank you. I'll try my best.

857
00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:35.869
- Thank you. - Thank you.

858
00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:37.270
- Thank you. - Thank you.

859
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.770
(1 hour before departure)

860
00:35:41.009 --> 00:35:43.079
I'm going to Vietnam all of a sudden.

861
00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:45.980
(His manager sees him off.)

862
00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.980
Bye.

863
00:35:47.909 --> 00:35:48.949
This isn't good.

864
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:52.219
(They move to Incheon Airport.)

865
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.590
Do the customers know that I'm coming?

866
00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:55.790
- No. - Not at all.

867
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:56.920
Really?

868
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.759
(He starts to feel the pressure.)

869
00:36:00.759 --> 00:36:01.960
This is driving me nuts.

870
00:36:03.029 --> 00:36:06.029
I'll try my best so that I don't cause any trouble.

871
00:36:06.029 --> 00:36:08.070
- It's okay. - I mean it.

872
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040
(Take me with you.)

873
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:14.770
It looks like they're going somewhere in school uniforms.

874
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.040
(Designated entrance)

875
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.279
- Don't say that. - You look cute.

876
00:36:17.279 --> 00:36:19.380
- Haha. - I think you look cute.

877
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.880
(It's almost time for departure.)

878
00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:24.449
(50 minutes before departure)

879
00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:28.449
Is this a role-playing facility?

880
00:36:29.259 --> 00:36:30.619
- No? - It's for adults.

881
00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:32.960
The plane doesn't fly. You're just inside.

882
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.460
Where's your teacher?

883
00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:36.659
(They're busy doing a flight inspection.)

884
00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:38.460
You cannot go through the back...

885
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.130
(They're busy with their respective duties.)

886
00:36:40.969 --> 00:36:42.139
Is there anything I can do?

887
00:36:42.969 --> 00:36:44.699
Excuse me.

888
00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:46.040
(He sits down.)

889
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.079
I didn't do any safety duties. It was all service duties.

890
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.949
I'm in trouble.

891
00:36:57.579 --> 00:36:59.449
The customers will check in now.

892
00:36:59.449 --> 00:37:01.489
It'll feel real once the customers come in.

893
00:37:01.489 --> 00:37:03.360
Did you still think it was a prank?

894
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.619
Once I got on the flight, I knew it was real.

895
00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:06.360
I had to check in.

896
00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:07.659
What do I do here?

897
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.659
You two will check the boarding passes.

898
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.199
- With her? - Yes, stay on this side.

899
00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.040
- Do I say hi first? - Yes, "hello".

900
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.670
"Hello"?

901
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.070
- Smile. - "May I check your tickets?"

902
00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:24.210
"We're checking the boarding passes. Please have them ready."

903
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.710
- They'll take them out. - "May I check your boarding pass?"

904
00:37:27.449 --> 00:37:30.380
The seat numbers are written in big letters but don't look at that.

905
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.619
Check the date and the flight number on top.

906
00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:34.989
Flight number 4703 is ready to board.

907
00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:38.190
Please take your positions.

908
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.159
Please try your best.

909
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.400
(He still can't believe he's doing this.)

910
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.429
I'm so nervous.

911
00:37:45.699 --> 00:37:48.770
- Excuse me. - Sure. Thank you.

912
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.469
Sorry.

913
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.270
Your cologne smells great.

914
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.770
You have to say things like that.

915
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.679
May I have some?

916
00:37:56.679 --> 00:37:58.610
- Sure. - It's important.

917
00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.449
Thank you. That's enough.

918
00:38:00.449 --> 00:38:01.449
Thank you.

919
00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.550
(He gains confidence through the cologne.)

920
00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:03.579
That's good.

921
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:06.790
(What is Se Hyeong's fate?)

922
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.420
You're so calm.

923
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.889
- I know I have no choice. - Right.

924
00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.759
It's so absurd.

925
00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:17.400
- I was speechless. - I wouldn't have reacted that way.

926
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.429
(The passengers are boarding.)

927
00:38:21.029 --> 00:38:22.040
Get ready.

928
00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:24.369
(He smiles widely.)

929
00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:25.909
I'm smiling.

930
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.440
- Hello. - Hello.

931
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.679
"Hello".

932
00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:31.040
Se Hyeong is good at greeting people.

933
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.480
Hello.

934
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.679
(He's nervous.)

935
00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.050
May I see your boarding pass, madam?

936
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.579
(May I see your boarding pass?)

937
00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:39.750
Please sit in your designated seats.

938
00:38:40.219 --> 00:38:41.320
- Ticket please. - Boarding pass, madam.

939
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.989
(Boring pass, madam?)

940
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.329
- Boring? - I was nervous.

941
00:38:46.759 --> 00:38:48.659
Thank you.

942
00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:52.130
There are many foreigners going to Ho Chi Minh City.

943
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.429
Thank you.

944
00:38:54.429 --> 00:38:55.599
Thank you.

945
00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.770
(I used my brain too much.)

946
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.940
Please sit in the front.

947
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.809
How many more people?

948
00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:03.579
10 people boarded. There are 180 people left.

949
00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:05.650
Okay. I can keep going.

950
00:39:06.509 --> 00:39:08.509
(Smiling)

951
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.980
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

952
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.290
- Hello. - Are you Yang Se Body?

953
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.889
- Yes. - Yang Se Body.

954
00:39:13.889 --> 00:39:15.619
Hello.

955
00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:18.489
Thank you.

956
00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.159
Thank you.

957
00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:21.759
Thank you.

958
00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.460
"Thank you."

959
00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:25.369
- He's good. - Thank you.

960
00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:28.469
I didn't think about the cameras.

961
00:39:30.199 --> 00:39:32.369
The overhead compartments are open.

962
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.440
We have to close them.

963
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.239
- As we go by? - Yes.

964
00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:39.409
If you do this, it makes too much noise.

965
00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:40.880
- Like this? - Yes.

966
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.119
Slightly.

967
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.779
(This is so meaningful.)

968
00:39:44.779 --> 00:39:46.619
- See? I am smiling. - Right.

969
00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:47.949
I keep smiling.

970
00:39:48.489 --> 00:39:51.889
You didn't care about the cameras?

971
00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.759
You're facing the camera.

972
00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:55.960
- There were passengers, - Okay.

973
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.059
so I kept on smiling.

974
00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:59.199
The camera is so obvious.

975
00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:00.570
No way.

976
00:40:01.429 --> 00:40:04.670
(He looks around the working space.)

977
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.779
(It's 10 minutes before the takeoff.)

978
00:40:09.009 --> 00:40:10.110
Welcome aboard.

979
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.679
All your electronic...

980
00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.150
devices can be used...

981
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.420
Will you be making the announcement?

982
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.579
Yes. I have to do it later.

983
00:40:17.579 --> 00:40:19.389
- My goodness. - That's incredible.

984
00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:21.290
That's insane.

985
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.520
My goodness.

986
00:40:22.659 --> 00:40:25.290
It goes like this, right? "Ladies and gentlemen..."

987
00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.929
- It's difficult to read it. - I know.

988
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.699
The pronunciation matters.

989
00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:31.130
(Se Hyeong has the most difficult task.)

990
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.670
(Other flight attendants are giving safety instructions.)

991
00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:37.540
(He continues to practice.)

992
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.309
Purchase...

993
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.239
- Purchase. - Purchase.

994
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.309
Let me write down the pronunciation.

995
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.579
Pur... What is it?

996
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.849
Purchase.

997
00:40:47.849 --> 00:40:50.880
(It looks like he came to the company to learn.)

998
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.489
Okay.

999
00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:55.020
(Study materials are the best.)

1000
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.690
(He looks like a Japanese boy.)

1001
00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:59.860
Do you have to do it in Japanese as well?

1002
00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:00.989
I learned later...

1003
00:41:00.989 --> 00:41:02.699
- that I don't have to. - Really?

1004
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:04.460
You don't need it on a flight to Ho Chi Minh City.

1005
00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.199
Why would you speak Japanese when you are going to Vietnam?

1006
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:08.170
We will be taking off shortly.

1007
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.840
For your safety, please fasten your seat belt.

1008
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.670
Please fasten your seat belt.

1009
00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:14.840
Please fasten your seat belt.

1010
00:41:14.969 --> 00:41:16.779
We are having all kinds of shoots.

1011
00:41:16.779 --> 00:41:17.840
(He is speechless.)

1012
00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.849
Seriously.

1013
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.909
For the safe takeoff,

1014
00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:22.920
we will dim the cabin lights.

1015
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.880
Ladies and gentlemen.

1016
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.889
(He twists his tongue.)

1017
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:31.090
(He reads out loud when everyone else is quiet.)

1018
00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.230
(He's eager to learn.)

1019
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.800
Are you sure you didn't do that for the shoot?

1020
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.029
Who does that?

1021
00:41:37.029 --> 00:41:38.300
- Look at his eyebrows. - Look at his eyebrows.

1022
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.800
It's obvious you did it for the shoot.

1023
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.800
Don't say that.

1024
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.400
I did my best...

1025
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.110
- not to be a burden. - I can see that.

1026
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.469
We will be taking off shortly.

1027
00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:50.739
(It's the last announcement before the takeoff.)

1028
00:41:51.739 --> 00:41:52.880
Here we go.

1029
00:41:55.009 --> 00:41:57.150
(He becomes curious...)

1030
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.020
(of what the other flight attendants are doing.)

1031
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:02.159
(2 hours pass by quickly.)

1032
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.360
(1 Hour Before starts.)

1033
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.259
(The flight will take about 5 hours and 30 minutes.)

1034
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.099
(Ringing)

1035
00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:13.599
When you hear that sound, you can take off your seat belt.

1036
00:42:17.199 --> 00:42:19.540
(Waddling)

1037
00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:23.210
Hello, I am the flight attendant, Yang Se Hyeong. Nice to meet you.

1038
00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.009
Well,

1039
00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.880
I will try my best to make your trip enjoyable and comfortable.

1040
00:42:28.949 --> 00:42:31.349
I ask for your understanding. Thank you.

1041
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:32.750
- "Thank you." - "Thank you."

1042
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.750
Thank you.

1043
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.320
I will go to you...

1044
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.020
if you want pictures.

1045
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.559
Feel free to ask.

1046
00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:40.059
It's good that you are friendly, but...

1047
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:41.929
- It's excessive. - It's...

1048
00:42:41.929 --> 00:42:44.460
Isn't it excessive?

1049
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.300
My voice came out better when I held it close to my ear.

1050
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:50.040
I do that when I answer Producer Kim Tae Ho's call.

1051
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.070
"Hello."

1052
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.670
(Laughing)

1053
00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:54.570
- Please take them down the aisle. - Okay.

1054
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.579
Please do it slowly and carefully.

1055
00:42:57.409 --> 00:43:00.079
(He looks like he is on his mom's errand.)

1056
00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.320
- Would you like some water? - Thank you.

1057
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.520
Thank you.

1058
00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:05.420
Would you like some water?

1059
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.449
(He is giving out water before the passengers ask.)

1060
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.090
Thank you.

1061
00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.719
(He is busy.)

1062
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.159
I want more water.

1063
00:43:13.159 --> 00:43:14.659
I will bring more water.

1064
00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:15.929
I will bring more water right away.

1065
00:43:15.929 --> 00:43:17.759
- I would like a cup too. - I will be there shortly.

1066
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:19.570
- Se Hyeong, - Yes.

1067
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.500
please make the announcement for the air-cafe...

1068
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.099
- so that we can begin. - Should I do it now? Okay.

1069
00:43:25.099 --> 00:43:26.340
- Should I do it now? - There he goes.

1070
00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:28.139
It's a crisis.

1071
00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:29.540
- Is the announcement in English? - Yes.

1072
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.179
I do it in Korean first.

1073
00:43:31.639 --> 00:43:32.779
Ladies and gentlemen,

1074
00:43:33.009 --> 00:43:35.320
our air-cafe service will now begin.

1075
00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:38.889
Please contact our cabin crew...

1076
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.250
if you would like to purchase air-cafe items.

1077
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:42.790
Ladies and gentlemen.

1078
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:46.190
(The English version begins.)

1079
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.460
(190 people are listening to Se Hyeong speaking English.)

1080
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.969
If you would like to purchase air-cafe items.

1081
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.770
- He is so annoying. - He is so annoying.

1082
00:43:55.869 --> 00:43:57.270
- He is so annoying. - Hey. Hey.

1083
00:43:57.469 --> 00:43:58.809
For goodness' sake.

1084
00:43:58.809 --> 00:43:59.869
(You are making a fool of yourself.)

1085
00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:02.239
(He is twisting his tongue...)

1086
00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:05.079
(to the best of his abilities.)

1087
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.110
(What is he saying?)

1088
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:09.179
He wants to do well.

1089
00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:10.550
It's all about the rhythm.

1090
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.550
She copied your hand gesture.

1091
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:15.050
(Rhythm? Check!)

1092
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.119
(Shall we become one in rhythm?)

1093
00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:18.259
Why did you put that clip in?

1094
00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:21.230
(What is Moon Vok doing there?)

1095
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.559
Korean top class

1096
00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:23.630
Ladies and gentlemen.

1097
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.630
Fabulous turbulence

1098
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.770
Our air-cafe service will now begin.

1099
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:27.829
Thank you.

1100
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:29.170
That's Moon Vok's legendary video.

1101
00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:32.969
This is driving me crazy.

1102
00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:35.980
(He sells the items after making the announcement.)

1103
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.279
We are passing through.

1104
00:44:38.279 --> 00:44:39.509
(Nervous)

1105
00:44:39.509 --> 00:44:40.779
That was really hard.

1106
00:44:40.779 --> 00:44:44.050
You had to move carefully down the narrow aisle.

1107
00:44:44.119 --> 00:44:45.949
You had to receive payment too.

1108
00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.520
I had to do that...

1109
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.259
and go to take water.

1110
00:44:49.489 --> 00:44:50.590
Four cup noodles.

1111
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.989
Four cup noodles.

1112
00:44:52.159 --> 00:44:53.389
He is sleeping.

1113
00:44:53.529 --> 00:44:55.429
- What? - He is sleeping.

1114
00:44:55.429 --> 00:44:56.800
(Are there 4 people in the party?)

1115
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.300
My wallet is in the overhead bin.

1116
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:59.770
Would you like 3 or 4 cup noodles?

1117
00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:00.929
- 4 cup noodles. - 4 cup noodles.

1118
00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:02.940
He is sleeping.

1119
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.199
- Is he sleeping? - Then give us three cup noodles.

1120
00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:06.409
Order four cup noodles. We can wake him up later.

1121
00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:08.270
Four cup noodles? Will you pay by card? Please wait.

1122
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.779
(His senior stays by his side.)

1123
00:45:10.779 --> 00:45:12.509
She is keeping an eye on him.

1124
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:15.750
- She helped me tremendously. - I know.

1125
00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.619
You can tell another cabin crew.

1126
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.349
Make sure you show this receipt.

1127
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.259
Please be careful. They are hot.

1128
00:45:24.259 --> 00:45:25.290
Give them to me.

1129
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.130
(She delivers the cup noodles in case Se Hyeong spills them.)

1130
00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.059
(3 cans of beer)

1131
00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:31.099
Three?

1132
00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:32.329
That's perfect.

1133
00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:33.869
"That's perfect"?

1134
00:45:33.869 --> 00:45:35.029
Flight attendants don't say that.

1135
00:45:35.029 --> 00:45:36.770
To prepare cup noodles, you have to move back and forth.

1136
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.770
- Beer is right in the cart. - That's perfect.

1137
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.710
I only had to type the number in.

1138
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:41.940
Let's see.

1139
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.579
(He gets better...)

1140
00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:45.210
(before he falters.)

1141
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.650
I am sorry.

1142
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.380
That must've been difficult.

1143
00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.719
(It's not easy.)

1144
00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:50.980
Of course, it's hard.

1145
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.650
Please pick a card.

1146
00:45:52.889 --> 00:45:54.389
- One person will pay the bill. - Yes.

1147
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:55.759
I will pay with this card.

1148
00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.360
(He offers a bit of entertainment as service.)

1149
00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.790
I don't know what I am doing.

1150
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:59.860
(He talks to the passengers.)

1151
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.059
Please enjoy.

1152
00:46:01.059 --> 00:46:02.230
(Passengers cheer him up.)

1153
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.130
I want to be a passenger of a plane he works in.

1154
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:06.429
"Hello."

1155
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.469
(He is proud of himself.)

1156
00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.239
When he gets off the flight,

1157
00:46:10.239 --> 00:46:11.969
Haha should throw him a party.

1158
00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:13.940
(Haha should throw him a party.)

1159
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.840
This is like "Life Experience".

1160
00:46:17.279 --> 00:46:19.409
It's like a battlefield.

1161
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.449
(He is preparing for another announcement.)

1162
00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:23.550
Inchulding?

1163
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.619
(Is that an English word?)

1164
00:46:24.619 --> 00:46:27.119
(Inchulding)

1165
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:29.559
- Including. - "Inchulding"?

1166
00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:31.389
- "Inchulding". - You saw it as the letter "H".

1167
00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:32.630
My goodness.

1168
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.759
- Anyone can be confused. - "Inchulding".

1169
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:37.130
(He pretends like he knew.)

1170
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.730
An electronic cigarette is prohibited...

1171
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:43.040
on the entire aircraft at all times.

1172
00:46:43.699 --> 00:46:45.509
Since some passengers were sleeping,

1173
00:46:45.509 --> 00:46:47.170
- I had to speak quietly. - You had to speak quietly.

1174
00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.940
Quietly.

1175
00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.210
I was instructed.

1176
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.409
Thank you for your cooperation.

1177
00:46:53.409 --> 00:46:55.449
(Don't be satisfied by that.)

1178
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.719
(The lights are turned off.)

1179
00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.389
- Now, you can rest. - Yes.

1180
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:02.860
- That looks delicious. - To be honest,

1181
00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.159
I am the most curious about this time.

1182
00:47:05.159 --> 00:47:06.989
I wonder, "What are the flight attendants doing?"

1183
00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.759
This is honestly so exhausting.

1184
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:09.929
It's hard, right?

1185
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.900
I only thought of this occupation...

1186
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.099
as something fancy.

1187
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.199
I didn't know it would be this hard.

1188
00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.340
I thought to myself,

1189
00:47:20.139 --> 00:47:21.739
"Why can't everyone just sleep?"

1190
00:47:23.409 --> 00:47:25.750
(I can't.)

1191
00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.779
Someone pushed the call button.

1192
00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:30.920
You are right.

1193
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.650
- Do most people request water? - Yes.

1194
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.320
- I see. - Most people...

1195
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.290
wake up in the middle of sleep...

1196
00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:39.829
and call us for water.

1197
00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:42.199
Ask the passenger if he or she needs anything...

1198
00:47:42.199 --> 00:47:43.329
and give water.

1199
00:47:43.329 --> 00:47:44.460
(If the passenger requests water, provide it right away.)

1200
00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:47.670
Excuse me.

1201
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.040
(He passes by the passenger.)

1202
00:47:50.599 --> 00:47:52.969
(No, no.)

1203
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.840
(A senior flight attendant goes to help.)

1204
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.880
Where is it?

1205
00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:01.880
This is the flight attendant call button.

1206
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.420
- Did you press the button? - Yes. Three cups of water, please.

1207
00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.050
Thank you.

1208
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.420
The passenger requested water.

1209
00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.119
- They were right. - They knew right away.

1210
00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:11.290
They were right.

1211
00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.460
There are so many things to do.

1212
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:13.529
Seriously.

1213
00:48:13.529 --> 00:48:15.329
They are the moms of the plane.

1214
00:48:15.329 --> 00:48:17.259
They are very professional.

1215
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.800
(Sighing)

1216
00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.969
(Se Hyeong finally gets some rest.)

1217
00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.440
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

1218
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.040
I hope you had a pleasant flight.

1219
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.779
We will be landing shortly at Tan Son Nhat International Airport.

1220
00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:32.949
(They arrive when he just sat down to rest.)

1221
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:36.920
I am in Vietnam.

1222
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.550
My goodness.

1223
00:48:38.719 --> 00:48:41.820
(Ho Chi Minh City)

1224
00:48:43.119 --> 00:48:47.889
(The passengers who flew for 5 hours and 50 minutes leave.)

1225
00:48:50.029 --> 00:48:52.630
(They have a safety check after the landing.)

1226
00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:54.429
Our work is complete.

1227
00:48:54.429 --> 00:48:55.570
Oh, yes.

1228
00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.540
(He exits proudly.)

1229
00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.909
Thank you for your hard work.

1230
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.579
Thank you.

1231
00:49:04.579 --> 00:49:06.550
- You did a good job. - The little flight attendant.

1232
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.550
- You worked hard. - The temperature is different.

1233
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.279
The little flight attendant.

1234
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.020
- The little flight attendant. - Thank you for your hard work.

1235
00:49:12.119 --> 00:49:13.989
(The little flight attendant's mission ends.)

1236
00:49:13.989 --> 00:49:15.050
It's Vietnam.

1237
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.420
(He arrives in Vietnam.)

1238
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.090
People are in short sleeves.

1239
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:21.590
(What do I do now?)

1240
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:24.630
(Laughing)

1241
00:49:25.699 --> 00:49:27.099
(You must eat pho when you are in Vietnam.)

1242
00:49:27.099 --> 00:49:28.639
It looks delicious.

1243
00:49:28.639 --> 00:49:29.739
It was really delicious.

1244
00:49:29.739 --> 00:49:31.869
The soup was 10 times richer...

1245
00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:33.139
than that of the pho we get here.

1246
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.779
(Impressed)

1247
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.509
(The boy who was left alone...)

1248
00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.550
(emptied a bowl of pho.)

1249
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:44.849
It's delicious. What is this?

1250
00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:46.889
(Then he returned to Korea after three hours.)

1251
00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.029
(1 Hour Before)

1252
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:53.790
The temperature was very different.

1253
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.400
In Seoul, it was minus 16 degrees Celsius.

1254
00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.099
In Ho Chi Minh City, it was 30 degrees Celsius.

1255
00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.400
There was a difference of 50 degrees Celsius.

1256
00:49:59.699 --> 00:50:02.900
It was hard to balance myself during the flight.

1257
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.599
I became nauseous.

1258
00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:06.639
I had a headache too,

1259
00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:08.540
and I kept laughing because it was so hard.

1260
00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.610
- You had to be focused. - Yes.

1261
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:12.079
- And... - You had to smile all the time.

1262
00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:15.320
Yes, I had to smile all the time. It was really hard.

1263
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:17.520
Was this harder than the interview?

1264
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.619
(Falling silent)

1265
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:22.960
- He's always having hardship. - Yes.

1266
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.920
- Everything's hard. - Yes.

1267
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.259
- Everything's hard nowadays. - Yes, nowadays...

1268
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.800
It's always like this.

1269
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.360
- They keep shooting extra scenes. - Myeong Soo wants to say something.

1270
00:50:31.429 --> 00:50:34.570
- No, I don't. - That's good. We need to watch now.

1271
00:50:35.739 --> 00:50:37.000
I had nothing in mind.

1272
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.670
This is scary. There's no one outside.

1273
00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:44.040
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1274
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.210
(He came out at 5am.)

1275
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:47.550
Where am I going? I can't even see.

1276
00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:51.020
(5:30am, Sae Ho arrives at the mission location.)

1277
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.219
He's arrived.

1278
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:56.820
(He came to Yeouido Station before dawn.)

1279
00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:02.199
(What will happen in 1 hour?)

1280
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:05.800
(Surprised)

1281
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.670
- Were you acting? - No, I wasn't.

1282
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:08.699
The car stopped abruptly.

1283
00:51:08.699 --> 00:51:10.369
- I think... - I have really big reactions.

1284
00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:11.840
- It's not acting. - You have big reactions?

1285
00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.340
I'm always like that.

1286
00:51:13.639 --> 00:51:15.110
- Sae Ho. - Yes?

1287
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.480
Wear the blindfold in front of you,

1288
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.509
and put the headphone on your ears.

1289
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:22.849
- Have I arrived? - Yes.

1290
00:51:22.849 --> 00:51:24.079
(His eyesight and hearing needs to be blocked for security reasons.)

1291
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.150
- The headset... - It was the scariest part.

1292
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.090
- It's scary. - You can hear music, right?

1293
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:30.759
(The door slides open.)

1294
00:51:30.759 --> 00:51:32.190
(He's surprised.)

1295
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.029
(With his eyes and ears covered, he has a keen sense of touch.)

1296
00:51:35.029 --> 00:51:36.630
- What? - Hold my hand.

1297
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:41.670
It's so cold. It's cold.

1298
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.670
- It was a really cold day. - That day...

1299
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.270
- It was the coldest day. - Gosh, the wind.

1300
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:49.179
The real feel temperature was minus 20°C.

1301
00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:51.739
(In the cold front, the real feel temperature was minus 20°C.)

1302
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:55.179
What? What is this?

1303
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.349
Who's this? Who is this?

Take off your blindfold.

Hello, I'm Lee Gui Joo, a weather forecaster at MBC.

- Happy new year. - Thank you.

Why am I here? Why?

1317
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.389
In one hour,

1318

you'll be reporting the weather forecast on live news...

1319

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:47.199
(I need to report the weather forecast right now?)

1321

Yes, you'll have to think of what it'd feel like to the citizens.

- Yes. - Describe the weather you feel.

(I don't prefer any side at all.)

Yes, I am hearing.

You are hearing?

1438
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.110
- You should say, "I can hear you." - Yes.

1439
00:57:55.139 --> 00:57:56.880
But I was a little nervous then.

1440
00:57:57.009 --> 00:57:58.340
Yes, I am hearing.

Do you see the mic in front of you? Hold it up.

1442

Hold the mic so that the blue side...

is in the front.

1444

- Cho Sae Ho. Cho Sae Ho. - You must mention that it's 15ºC,

1445
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.659
- You need to go right, and... - and the real feel is minus 20ºC.

1446
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.290
You must also say that it's the coldest day today.

1447

- In Seoul it's minus 15°C. - Cho Sae Ho...

- Yes. - The anchor will call you soon.

There's been a cold front warning all over the country.

1459
00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.320
- And a cold front watch for Seoul. - Yes.

1460
00:58:42.389 --> 00:58:45.020
There's been a cold front warning all over the country,

1461
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.559
and I'm Cho Sae Ho, your weather forecaster today.

1462
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.529
- It's minus 15ºC in Seoul. - Yes.

1463
00:58:49.529 --> 00:58:51.929
The real feel temperature is minus 20°C.

1464
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.699
We can see from looking at your face that it's cold.

1465
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.599
There's too much makeup on your chin.

1466
00:58:58.599 --> 00:59:01.009
- It's because of the cold. - It's frozen.

1467
00:59:01.139 --> 00:59:03.779
- You're only white in the middle. - The other parts are not.

1468
00:59:03.779 --> 00:59:05.009
It's like a mask.

1469
00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:08.679
(The cold has made him a mask with two chins.)

1470
00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:11.279
- You just need to go like that. - Yes.

1471
00:59:11.279 --> 00:59:13.020
- Cho Sae Ho. - Yes?

1472
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:16.860
- At about 6:47 or 6:48am, - Yes?

1473
00:59:17.219 --> 00:59:20.659
the anchor will call you from the studio.

1474
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:23.429
- Yes. - When he does, talk to him.

1475
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:24.900
- Yes. - After that,

1476
00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:27.400
you can report the weather forecast.

1477
00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.199
- All right. But can I smile? - Yes.

1478
00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:32.110
- Do as you want. - All right. Yes.

1479
00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:36.779
Hello. Wait, can I say "Hello?"

1480
00:59:37.079 --> 00:59:38.440
- Like... - Yes, you can.

1481
00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:42.250
Hello. There's been a cold front warning all over the country.

1482
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.690
Sae Ho, there's 3 minutes to go. 3 minutes.

1483
00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:48.690
- Gosh. - Gosh, three minutes? What's this?

1484
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.020
- There three minutes left? - Yes. It happened so fast.

1485
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.690
- What's going on? - It starts at 6:48am.

1486
00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.389
Get a hold of yourself.

1487
00:59:55.259 --> 00:59:57.960
Sae Ho, clear your head, and try it out until the end.

1488
00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:00.630
I know it's a little too sudden,

1489
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.570
but I'm Reporter Cho Sae Ho, reporting from Yeouido Station.

1490
01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.869
Today, there's been a cold front warning.

1491
01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.840
I'm sure you all feel cold today.

1492
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.309
From the afternoon, the temperature will go up,

1493
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:12.880
so don't worry...

1494
01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.179
- It won't go up. - it won't?

1495
01:00:14.179 --> 01:00:15.210
No.

1496
01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.880
It'll be cold all day.

1497
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.690
Okay, I got it.

1498
01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.690
It'll be very cold today.

1499
01:00:22.389 --> 01:00:24.759
30 seconds, Sae Ho.

1500
01:00:24.759 --> 01:00:26.590
Get ready.

1501
01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.429
There are 30 seconds left.

1502
01:00:28.429 --> 01:00:30.300
- You must be so nervous. - Standby.

1503
01:00:30.529 --> 01:00:32.369
- Today's weather... - Stop practicing, Sae Ho.

1504
01:00:32.369 --> 01:00:34.670
Stop practicing. Standby.

1505
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:37.170
- Okay. - Look at the camera.

1506
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:38.840
25,000...

1507
01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.309
I'm nervous. I can do this.

1508
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.210
(Shivering)

1509
01:00:44.279 --> 01:00:46.480
If you get confused, say "That was today's weather."

1510
01:00:47.679 --> 01:00:49.650
(That's his secret strategy.)

1511
01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:50.949
My hands are getting sweaty.

1512
01:00:50.949 --> 01:00:52.849
The news is almost done. Standby.

1513
01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:54.050
I'm nervous.

1514
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.590
Why am I nervous?

1515
01:00:55.590 --> 01:00:58.259
Me too. The directors are nervous.

1516
01:00:58.259 --> 01:00:59.489
(Cold front warning)

1517
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.159
(Minus 15°C in Seoul)

1518
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.659
(If he gets blanked out, it's "That was today's weather.")

1519
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:08.840
I'm nervous for him. It's live.

1520
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.869
My gosh.

1521
01:01:09.869 --> 01:01:11.469
It's MBC News.

1522
01:01:11.469 --> 01:01:12.809
Cut to the anchor.

1523
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.509
It'll go as low as minus 15°C. It's the coldest so far.

1524
01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:19.679
(Shivering)

1525
01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.849
(They can't breathe right now.)

1526
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:24.679
- He's nervous. - We have Reporter Cho Sae Ho.

1527
01:01:24.679 --> 01:01:26.889
- I'm so nervous. - Switch the screen.

1528
01:01:26.889 --> 01:01:28.719
We have Reporter Cho Sae Ho.

1529
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.190
Hello, Sae Ho.

1530
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:36.929
Nice to meet you. I'm weather forecaster, Cho Sae Ho.

1531
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.969
He's trying to look relaxed.

1532
01:01:41.099 --> 01:01:42.739
I'm weather forecaster, Cho Sae Ho.

1533
01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:45.969
- You look cold. - Happy new year.

1534
01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:47.570
(He interrupts the anchor.)

1535
01:01:48.239 --> 01:01:50.279
(Goodness)

1536
01:01:50.279 --> 01:01:53.449
- Yes, it's cold. - He should have listened.

1537
01:01:54.279 --> 01:01:56.320
(The anchor doesn't panic.)

1538
01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.590
How did you become a weather forecaster on such a cold day?

1539
01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:00.949
(He can't hide his breath.)

1540
01:02:00.949 --> 01:02:05.790
I thought it'll be meaningful to deliver the weather on a cold day,

1541
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.059
so I came here with no hesitation.

1542
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.400
Today is very cold.

1543
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.670
My ears are very cold right now.

1544
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.139
You're saying "very" many times.

1545
01:02:18.199 --> 01:02:23.179
As you see behind me, many people are going to work.

1546
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:26.050
Reflecting today's weather,

1547
01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:31.380
they're wearing thick jackets going to work.

1548
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.320
- Yes. - Yes.

1549
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.320
(They both say "yes".)

1550
01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.360
And...

1551
01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.360
Are they copying each other?

1552
01:02:38.489 --> 01:02:40.029
No...

1553
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:43.259
- Yes. - And...

1554
01:02:43.329 --> 01:02:44.659
the coldest weather...

1555
01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:46.230
Let's pass Sae Ho.

1556
01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.570
"Let's pass Sae Ho"?

1557
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:48.670
There are no questions.

1558
01:02:49.139 --> 01:02:52.909
The coldest weather is in Hoengseong with minus 24°C.

1559
01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:56.409
It's 19.2°C in Paju, and 11.8°C in Jeonju.

1560
01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.779
The cold weather has reached its peak.

1561
01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:01.679
Standby. Switch the camera.

1562
01:03:01.679 --> 01:03:04.119
Today is especially cold,

1563
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:07.520
so please welcome your family members warmly...

1564
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.759
when they come home from work.

1565
01:03:11.759 --> 01:03:14.029
Please say something warm...

1566
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:16.099
(It's a sensitive weather forecast.)

1567
01:03:16.099 --> 01:03:17.099
That's irrelevant.

1568
01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:18.099
(He's straight forward.)

1569
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.130
- Nobody told you that, right? - It's unnecessary.

1570
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:24.340
I thought I was doing well. They said everybody liked it.

1571
01:03:24.369 --> 01:03:28.980
I think you'll feel your family's warmth.

1572
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.150
Have a great day. That was today's weather.

1573
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:34.179
End it.

1574
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.980
- Start. - That was today's weather.

1575
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.320
(The screen switches over.)

1576
01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.119
- Gosh. - It's hard to remember, right?

1577
01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:46.590
I thought he was going to ask me questions, but he didn't.

1578
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:47.759
Did I do okay?

1579
01:03:48.059 --> 01:03:49.059
Well...

1580
01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.869
You didn't say anything about cold weather alert. You missed Seoul.

1581
01:03:52.869 --> 01:03:55.029
You have to say it in the next one. It's minus 15°C in Seoul.

1582
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:57.239
- We practiced. - He missed something.

1583
01:03:57.239 --> 01:03:59.509
The cold front warning is the most important part.

1584
01:03:59.509 --> 01:04:00.940
He missed that?

1585
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.079
You have to talk about the weather.

1586
01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:06.150
You didn't talk enough about it. It has to be in your head.

1587
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.480
Was that a broadcasting accident?

1588
01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.750
- No. - No.

1589
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:13.650
People look up the weather before going to work.

1590
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.960
- Right. - Your biggest mistake was...

1591
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.690
not saying "minus" when you talked about the temperatures.

1592
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:20.329
You just said "15°C".

1593
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:22.900
People went outside wearing t-shirts.

1594
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.570
- Really? - They're suing you.

1595
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.969
- You need to prepare. - Didn't you compliment him?

1596
01:04:26.969 --> 01:04:29.040
- You need 30 million dollars. - Se Hyeong.

1597
01:04:29.639 --> 01:04:31.040
Do I have to change?

1598
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.869
(Shivering)

1599
01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:39.050
(He'll be going live again in 30 minutes.)

1600
01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:41.110
Is it live the whole time?

1601
01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.579
Yes, that's right.

1602
01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.449
I shouldn't put on dress shoes today.

1603
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.790
It's MBC News.

1604
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.690
Start. Let's go with camera 2 and 4.

1605
01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:53.929
Let's check Gui Joo's audio.

1606
01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.190
(Everybody is busy on set.)

1607
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.800
(Everybody is busy on set.)

1608
01:04:58.199 --> 01:04:59.199
(He's busy as well.)

1609
01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:01.529
This is so hectic.

1610
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.770
- That's the top. - Okay.

1611
01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:07.210
"Hello, I'm your weather forecaster today, Cho Sae Ho."

1612
01:05:07.369 --> 01:05:08.469
(Thinking)

1613
01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:11.880
Why am I changing? What is this costume for?

1614
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.509
Do I just do it?

1615
01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:15.550
I'm a weather forecaster. Why am I wearing a costume?

1616
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.320
We had to get ready fast, so I didn't know what was going on.

1617
01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.090
- You didn't? - We had get ready.

1618
01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:22.659
Are you gluing something on?

1619
01:05:22.659 --> 01:05:23.889
You're going to be Yi Sun Shin.

1620
01:05:23.889 --> 01:05:25.630
- Admiral Yi Sun Shin? - Yes.

1621
01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:28.159
(Do you have to dress as Yi Sun Shin for the winter?)

1622
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.559
(He practices his lines.)

1623
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.369
I'm going to be Admiral Yi Sun Shin.

1624
01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:38.840
Was it winter when he went to war?

1625
01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:41.110
Japanese invasion.

1626
01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:45.040
Put on the small grains.

1627
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.509
What are you putting on?

1628
01:05:47.579 --> 01:05:48.579
What's this?

1629
01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.320
(Dabbing)

1630
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.989
I don't think this is Admiral Yi Sun Shin.

1631
01:05:54.219 --> 01:05:55.219
You'll be Jack Frost.

1632
01:05:55.219 --> 01:05:57.690
Jack Frost? It's not Admiral Yi Sun Shin.

1633
01:05:57.690 --> 01:05:59.860
It's kind of like him.

1634
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.889
Right.

1635
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.429
"I became Jack Frost to express today's weather."

1636
01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:05.869
"That is it for today."

1637
01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:07.969
Ouch, that hurts.

1638
01:06:08.199 --> 01:06:09.670
He looks like Justice Pao.

1639
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.440
Me? I see.

1640
01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:14.009
I never imagined I'd be wearing this in the morning.

1641
01:06:14.009 --> 01:06:15.880
Please dress warmly...

1642
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.210
Screen out.

1643
01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.849
(The news continues on the cold front warning.)

1644
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:21.380
Ms. Lee Gui Joo?

1645
01:06:21.809 --> 01:06:23.380
What are we going to do with Sae Ho's part?

1646
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380
Excuse me.

1647
01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.690
He didn't say anything about the temperature.

1648
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.920
Let's just give up.

1649
01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:31.290
Once you stand there, you blank out.

1650
01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:33.559
I hope there is some coaching...

1651
01:06:33.759 --> 01:06:35.829
on site.

1652
01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:37.929
Sae Ho.

1653
01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:40.570
- Yes? - How was it?

1654
01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.170
I think I didn't...

1655
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.900
- deliver the right information. - That's true.

1656
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.340
I feel bad for not mentioning the weather in Seoul.

1657
01:06:47.469 --> 01:06:49.279
"Today's weather in Seoul is minus 15°C."

1658
01:06:49.279 --> 01:06:52.679
"The real feel temperature is as low as minus 20°C."

1659
01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:54.880
"The cold weather..."

1660
01:06:56.119 --> 01:06:59.449
Why can't I conclude?

1661
01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:00.949
Because it's cold.

1662
01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:03.389
"It is very cold today."

1663
01:07:03.389 --> 01:07:04.989
It's good to get help.

1664
01:07:05.529 --> 01:07:07.590
"The cold weather might give you some trouble."

1665
01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.900
The anchor will ask you something.

1666
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.300
We don't know the questions, right?

1667
01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.869
- They'll tell us. - Okay.

1668
01:07:12.869 --> 01:07:16.940
Once he asks a question, there's a two-second delay.

1669
01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.670
I was waiting for him, and he didn't say anything.

1670
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:22.340
That was the two second. You didn't wait and said something.

1671
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.409
So you have to wait.

1672
01:07:24.409 --> 01:07:26.880
Are important people mad?

1673
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.880
- No. - That's a relief.

1674
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.380
It wouldn't affect my future, right?

1675
01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.590
No, you'll be fine.

1676
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.949
He's used to going from place to place.

1677
01:07:34.949 --> 01:07:37.159
- I have to be self-conscious. - That's right.

1678
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.059
On standby. Let's put the mikes on.

1679
01:07:40.659 --> 01:07:43.130
- It's MBC News. - Cut to the anchor.

1680
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:44.559
The Minister of Justice...

1681
01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:47.329
Sae Ho needs to get ready.

1682
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.770
He looks like a lazy general in the Joseon Dynasty era.

1683
01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.779
I am a general who froze while sleeping.

1684
01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.679
What's going on?

1685
01:07:58.679 --> 01:08:00.750
(Rushing)

1686
01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:04.650
(He gets into position.)

1687
01:08:05.389 --> 01:08:08.219
It's 15.1°C, right?

1688
01:08:08.219 --> 01:08:10.159
They're asking to have it repealed.

1689
01:08:10.389 --> 01:08:12.989
(He sees Sae Ho on the screen.)

1690
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:14.689
(Giggling)

1691
01:08:14.689 --> 01:08:16.659
- He's cracking up. - I am shocked.

1692
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:18.460
(He feels pressured.)

1693
01:08:19.369 --> 01:08:21.500
(Everyone is laughing.)

1694
01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.769
The general is here.

1695
01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:25.040
The virtual currency...

1696
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.939
I laughed so much.

1697
01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:29.210
It suits Sae Ho very well.

1698
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:30.380
It was so funny.

1699
01:08:32.409 --> 01:08:34.310
- The jeans? - It's real.

1700
01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:36.579
(It was soaked 30 minutes ago.)

1701
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.790
It would freeze...

1702
01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:40.390
when you lay it out.

1703
01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.790
(It froze quickly.)

1704
01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.790
- It's frozen pants. - That's unbelievable.

1705
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.800
Should I put gloves on or not?

1706
01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.899
Jack Frost...

1707
01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:54.869
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1708
01:08:54.869 --> 01:08:56.569
(He's high maintenance.)

1709
01:08:57.199 --> 01:08:58.300
What's going on?

1710
01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:01.470
- It looks cold. - It was so cold.

1711
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.380
This is unbelievable.

1712
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.210
They told me to come in the morning.

1713
01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:10.350
(He's in the middle of Yeouido.)

1714
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.880
They told me...

1715
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:13.850
to come at 5am.

1716
01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.250
He's in Yeouido Station.

1717
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:16.390
I slept for an hour.

1718
01:09:17.159 --> 01:09:19.260
- 10 minutes. - There's 1 more.

1719
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:21.689
It's coming to an end. Standby.

1720
01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.060
What is the temperature in Seoul?

1721
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.260
- It's 15°C. It's minus 15°C. - Right.

1722
01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.399
There's a cold front warning all over the country.

1723
01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:30.640
Please emphasize that today is the coldest day of the year.

1724
01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:32.569
He looks so cool.

1725
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.479
- You can't answer for too long. - Okay.

1726
01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:36.479
(He must mention the jeans and answer questions.)

1727
01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.479
Can you zoom out a bit?

1728
01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.750
You have one minute left, Sae Ho.

1729
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.290
(Let's not make the same mistakes again.)

1730
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.290
(Please be considerate.)

1731
01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:52.590
- He's cute. - My feet are frozen.

1732
01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:54.290
Take your feet...

1733
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.290
(Falling)

1734
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.630
- It's good that wasn't live. - It fell over.

1735
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:59.670
Standby. Standby!

1736
01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:01.000
(He left the screen suddenly.)

1737
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.640
(That was close.)

1738
01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.699
My gosh.

1739
01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.510
(He quickly goes to his spot.)

1740
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:07.540
(Swallowing)

1741
01:10:09.279 --> 01:10:10.939
He must be nervous, right?

1742
01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:12.279
- Standby. - Of course.

1743
01:10:12.279 --> 01:10:14.750
- That's always nerve-racking. - It is.

1744
01:10:15.079 --> 01:10:18.720
Recently, a cold front has come, and the whole country is frozen.

1745
01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:20.220
As you have seen,

1746
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.960
a special weather forecaster has joined us today.

1747
01:10:23.159 --> 01:10:25.529
Cho Sae Ho is waiting for us in front of Yeouido Station.

1748
01:10:25.529 --> 01:10:27.260
Let's call for him again.

1749
01:10:27.689 --> 01:10:30.760
Sae Ho, you look colder than you did before.

1750
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.899
(1 second, 2 seconds, go)

1751
01:10:32.899 --> 01:10:35.840
The weather has gotten colder than before.

1752
01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.810
Hello, I'm today's weather forecaster, Cho Sae Ho.

1753
01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:41.210
I'm sure many of you are surprised...

1754
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.909
by my costume.

1755
01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:45.449
I am trying to express today's weather through my costume.

1756
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:47.579
I dressed as Jack Frost...

1757
01:10:47.579 --> 01:10:49.949
- to show the weather today. - He's very good.

1758
01:10:49.949 --> 01:10:52.390
- Right here. - You're better than before.

1759
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:54.050
The weather has gotten colder,

1760
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.590
and the real feel temperature is at minus 20°C.

1761
01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.189
I'm sure you've seen a lot of weather forecasts before.

1762
01:11:00.359 --> 01:11:03.130
- How do you feel since you're... - Yes.

1763
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:04.229
giving the forecast today?

1764
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:05.670
(1 second, 2 seconds)

1765
01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:07.970
- Now, he knows. - I think this is a hard job.

1766
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.600
To come out in this cold weather...

1767
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.109
so that they can tell many people the weather...

1768
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.869
is not an easy task.

1769
01:11:14.869 --> 01:11:16.810
I always heard the weather...

1770
01:11:16.909 --> 01:11:18.979
comfortably at home,

1771
01:11:18.979 --> 01:11:20.510
but now that I'm here,

1772
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:23.449
I realized how hard the forecasters work to tell us the weather.

1773
01:11:23.449 --> 01:11:25.890
I was able to experience the effort put into their work.

1774
01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:29.290
Please give us the weather forecast now.

1775
01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.760
I will tell you once again.

1776
01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.529
At the moment, there has been a warning for the cold front.

1777
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.859
The weather in Seoul is minus 15°C,

1778
01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:37.960
and the real feel temperature is at minus 20°C.

1779
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.899
I brought a prop with me today.

1780
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.939
If you look, this is a pair of jeans.

1781
01:11:42.939 --> 01:11:45.140
About 30 minutes ago,

1782
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:46.769
I put a pair of wet jeans outside.

1783
01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.909
But it has frozen like this.

1784
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.579
- These jeans show... - How much are they?

1785
01:11:51.579 --> 01:11:52.579
- how cold the weather is... - How much are they?

1786
01:11:52.579 --> 01:11:54.149
- with me, Jack Frost. - How much are the frozen jeans?

1787
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.579
- As you can see here. - I feel cold just looking at that.

1788
01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:59.550
Everyone, please make sure to dress warmly today.

1789
01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:01.949
I would like to suggest that you send your friends...

1790
01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.119
a warm-hearted text message...

1791
01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:07.060
asking if they're doing well.

1792
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:09.229
This was today's weather forecast.

1793
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:12.729
Goodness, he did a good job.

1794
01:12:12.729 --> 01:12:13.729
(Great job.)

1795
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.699
- He did a great job. - He really did.

1796
01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.140
This was today's weather forecast.

1797
01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.239
Start!

1798
01:12:18.739 --> 01:12:20.640
Camera three, please standby.

1799
01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:22.340
He did a great job.

1800
01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.810
He did a very great job.

1801
01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:25.949
- This was today's weather forecast. - You're right. It was better.

1802
01:12:25.949 --> 01:12:27.149
He's getting complimented.

1803
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:28.949
- Sae Ho, you did a great job. - It's so cold.

1804
01:12:29.019 --> 01:12:30.819
In 10 minutes, you'll go back on air.

1805
01:12:30.819 --> 01:12:31.989
This is your last broadcast.

1806
01:12:31.989 --> 01:12:34.350
You'll ask people how they feel about the cold weather.

1807
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.060
- "Let me interview some people." - Exactly.

1808
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.220
There's nothing we can do if they won't agree to interview.

1809
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.659
Okay. We're going to capture it realistically.

1810
01:12:39.859 --> 01:12:40.960
(The weather forecast timetable for "News Today")

1811
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.760
(Sae Ho is on air at 6:48am, 7:18am, and 7:30am.)

1812
01:12:43.899 --> 01:12:45.630
The iconic scene...

1813
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:48.170
- will come out now, right? - Yes, you're right.

1814
01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:52.109
Many people are coming out of the subway station...

1815
01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:53.340
to go to work.

1816
01:12:53.409 --> 01:12:55.609
They are all coming out of the station, right?

1817
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:57.779
How many people should I interview?

1818
01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.979
- I just need to... - 1 or 2 people?

1819
01:12:58.979 --> 01:13:00.279
- You can interview 1 or 2 people. - Then I should...

1820
01:13:00.279 --> 01:13:01.310
- He should interview two people. - Yes.

1821
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.750
- Can you hear me, Sae Ho? - Yes, I can.

1822
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.689
Don't turn your back on the camera.

1823
01:13:06.689 --> 01:13:08.119
- I'll go like this. - Yes, exactly.

1824
01:13:08.119 --> 01:13:09.460
(Don't worry, I'll go like this.)

1825
01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:12.260
Hello.

1826
01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.689
I'll go in this direction.

1827
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.930
Then I'll bring them over here.

1828
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:17.699
Yes, that's great.

1829
01:13:19.399 --> 01:13:20.600
Since he did it once,

1830
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.369
he's gotten a lot more confident.

1831
01:13:23.069 --> 01:13:24.369
- He's confident. - Up until now,

1832
01:13:24.369 --> 01:13:25.840
he's been showing a very professional side of himself.

1833
01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.210
I am getting the hang of it now.

1834
01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.979
It's three minutes before the live broadcast.

1835
01:13:28.979 --> 01:13:31.439
(He is suddenly on the streets of Yeouido.)

1836
01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:32.510
What should we do?

1837
01:13:32.779 --> 01:13:34.850
(He greets Jack Frost with a runny nose.)

1838
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:36.119
He's cute.

1839
01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:40.119
(The news broadcast is coming to an end.)

1840
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.220
- That's coming out! - What?

1841
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:43.359
- What is that? - Goodness.

1842
01:13:43.359 --> 01:13:45.260
- Did you go there? - Oh, my goodness.

1843
01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:46.359
(Jae Seok suddenly gets angry while watching the news.)

1844
01:13:47.329 --> 01:13:50.060
(Please check out the reason next week.)

1845
01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.600
I'm Yoo Na Eun of MBC news.

1846
01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.699
Cut to the anchor.

1847
01:13:54.199 --> 01:13:57.540
The weather in Seoul today is at a low of minus 15°C.

1848
01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.970
Please be ready.

1849
01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:00.939
(It's 10 seconds to the live broadcast.)

1850
01:14:02.079 --> 01:14:04.739
This time, the female and male anchors are both on.

1851
01:14:04.739 --> 01:14:06.750
- Okay. - Both of them are on this time.

1852
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:10.680
Today, Comedian Cho Sae Ho, has joined us as our weather forecaster.

1853
01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.489
- Shall we call on him again? - Yes.

1854
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.619
He's outside at Yeouido Station. Se Ho, are you there?

1855
01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:16.920
(He moves slowly to the center.)

1856
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:18.689
Yes, I am.

1857
01:14:19.359 --> 01:14:21.460
How can they look at him without laughing?

1858
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.729
- That's what I'm saying. - I'm here in Yeouido.

1859
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
- I'm today's weather forecaster. - It's incredible that they aren't.

1860
01:14:25.569 --> 01:14:28.840
Currently, I'm standing outside waiting to interview...

1861
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.569
the many people who are on their way...

1862
01:14:31.569 --> 01:14:33.069
to work.

1863
01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.340
Before you tell us the weather,

1864
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.680
you recently joined "Infinite Challenge".

1865
01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.180
- How do you feel? - She suddenly asked me that.

1866
01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.250
You didn't know she would ask that?

1867
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.380
No, I didn't know.

1868
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.579
Personally, I'm very happy about it.

1869
01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:44.180
- I really wanted to join... - Your lips are frozen.

1870
01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.519
- the show. - My lips were completely frozen.

1871
01:14:45.519 --> 01:14:47.720
I feel like "Infinite Challenge" is my program.

1872
01:14:47.989 --> 01:14:49.659
As a result,

1873
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.989
I feel happy and glad about it.

1874
01:14:52.329 --> 01:14:54.890
If I think about that, I don't feel cold at all.

1875
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.159
I compared it to the weather.

1876
01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.069
- Goodness. - Up until now, the mood is great.

1877
01:15:00.069 --> 01:15:01.430
They're laughing about it.

1878
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:04.640
Lastly, please interview the commuters and tell us the weather.

1879
01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:08.540
Many people are on their way to work to start their day.

1880
01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.380
Do you have time for an interview?

1881
01:15:10.479 --> 01:15:14.210
Many people are busy starting their day.

1882
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.579
Are you...

1883
01:15:15.579 --> 01:15:17.449
Are you available for an interview?

1884
01:15:17.449 --> 01:15:18.619
(He has his back turned to the camera.)

1885
01:15:18.619 --> 01:15:19.920
May I interview you, sir?

1886
01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.350
They told him not to turn his back to the camera.

1887
01:15:22.659 --> 01:15:24.489
No one would get interviewed by someone dressed like that.

1888
01:15:24.489 --> 01:15:25.960
(Your face must come out, Sae Ho!)

1889
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:27.489
Are you available for an interview?

1890
01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.130
Are you available for an interview?

1891
01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.930
The weather is very cold.

1892
01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:34.369
Many people are walking quickly to their destination.

1893
01:15:34.369 --> 01:15:35.500
(I am saying things to continue the flow.)

1894
01:15:36.569 --> 01:15:38.470
Are you available for an interview?

1895
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.140
Hello.

1896
01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.979
Are you available for a short interview?

1897
01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:44.880
Are you available for a short interview?

1898
01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.550
They see him, but...

1899
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:48.350
- They're embarrassed. - That's right.

1900
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.149
Perhaps it's because I'm dressed like this,

1901
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:53.290
many people...

1902
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:55.290
are confused as to who I am.

1903
01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:56.460
- "Confused". - I'll try to interview someone.

1904
01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.519
"Confused".

1905
01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.689
(What is with his confidence?)

1906
01:16:00.529 --> 01:16:01.960
You have to grab them for an interview.

1907
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.699
He must have been shocked.

1908
01:16:03.829 --> 01:16:06.369
Hello. Are you available for a short interview?

1909
01:16:06.369 --> 01:16:07.930
(The people are cold towards Sae Ho.)

1910
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.239
Hello.

1911
01:16:09.569 --> 01:16:10.939
Are you available for a short interview?

1912
01:16:10.939 --> 01:16:13.010
(The interviewer in front of Yeouido Station exit 5 needs attention.)

1913
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:14.840
Are you available for a short interview?

1914
01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:16.779
(Please have an interview with him.)

1915
01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.409
Have a nice day.

1916
01:16:18.409 --> 01:16:20.079
(He says nice things to them.)

1917
01:16:20.479 --> 01:16:21.909
At this point,

1918
01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:23.920
I think that the only thing I can do...

1919
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.119
is wish the commuters a good day.

1920
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:29.659
But I will try a little bit more.

1921
01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:31.659
Can I interview...

1922
01:16:32.659 --> 01:16:34.189
Have a nice day.

1923
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.000
(It's the miracle of Jack Frost.)

1924
01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.229
Have a nice day.

1925
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:38.729
(The sea of people divide in 2 in front of Se Ho.)

1926
01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:39.729
Hello.

1927
01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.970
- Have a nice day. - He's just saying hi to people.

1928
01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:43.500
May I interview you briefly?

1929
01:16:43.869 --> 01:16:45.069
May I interview you briefly?

1930
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:46.840
Have a nice day.

1931
01:16:48.369 --> 01:16:51.579
(No, I can't watch this anymore.)

1932
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:53.409
Sae Ho?

1933
01:16:54.079 --> 01:16:55.279
Sae Ho?

1934
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.449
Yes?

1935
01:16:57.449 --> 01:16:59.489
- The commuters are so busy. - Yes, they are.

1936
01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:00.949
- I think an interview will be hard. - Yes.

1937
01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.159
Yes, you're correct.

1938
01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:04.960
- It's colder than other days, - "Yes, you're correct."

1939
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.659
so it seems like they are in a hurry...

1940
01:17:07.659 --> 01:17:10.260
to get to their warm offices.

1941
01:17:10.329 --> 01:17:12.529
We'll go over to the anchors for the closing comments.

1942
01:17:12.699 --> 01:17:15.640
They say that the weather will get warmer on the day after tomorrow.

1943
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.939
Please be patient until then.

1944
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.510
There has been a cold front warning for the entire country.

1945
01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.479
He does everything he needs to.

1946
01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.779
(His comments about the weather are sensible.)

1947
01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:28.409
The weather in Seoul is minus 15.1°C.

1948
01:17:28.409 --> 01:17:29.550
The real feel temperature is...

1949
01:17:29.819 --> 01:17:31.779
(Goodness.)

1950
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:36.220
It is close to minus 20°C.

1951
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.920
Please dress warmly,

1952
01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.390
and have a warm-hearted day.

1953
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:42.300
I am Cho Sae Ho for the weather.

1954
01:17:44.399 --> 01:17:45.670
Cut to the anchors.

1955
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.329
- It ended well though. - Okay.

1956
01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:49.040
Sae Ho matched the time perfectly.

1957
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.769
Sae Ho finished his comments perfectly.

1958
01:17:51.769 --> 01:17:53.409
(He successfully ended the live broadcast in time.)

1959
01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.010
- Thank you, Sae Ho. - He's good.

1960
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.949
(He was very desperate to succeed.)

1961
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.119
- You did great today. - Good job, everyone.

1962
01:18:02.119 --> 01:18:03.380
Thank you.

1963
01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:05.220
Is it okay that I couldn't interview anyone?

1964
01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.720
(At least it ended well.)

1965
01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.960
My feet are so cold.

1966
01:18:09.519 --> 01:18:11.060
I heard that...

1967
01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:14.590
many people were getting ready for work like any other day.

1968
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:17.859
But when they turned on the TV to watch the weather,

1969
01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.600
he made everyone laugh so hard.

1970
01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.369
- So many people had a good day. - They were happy.

1971
01:18:22.869 --> 01:18:25.040
They all thanked him in the comments.

1972
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.239
In a way, I'm grateful to them.

1973
01:18:27.239 --> 01:18:29.710
Earlier, while watching the news, I was very surprised.

1974
01:18:29.979 --> 01:18:31.380
- I don't know who sent me, but... - You went, didn't you?

1975
01:18:31.979 --> 01:18:33.109
(What on earth happened to him?)

1976
01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.479
- In front of me... - Really?

1977
01:18:34.479 --> 01:18:36.720
(Next week)

1978
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.079
Should I take it off?

1979
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:39.319
Goodness, what is this?

1980
01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:41.290
You know I'm afraid of heights.

1981
01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.220
We have two hours left, so you must hurry.

1982
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.359
(This is for Jae Seok, who is afraid of heights.)

1983
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:49.199
(It is an intense situation for him.)

1984
01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:52.729
(Is this a surprise fan meeting for Jun Ha?)

1985
01:18:54.369 --> 01:18:56.869
(No, it isn't.)

1986
01:18:57.439 --> 01:18:59.439
(It's a gift that will wake him up. It's a marathon.)

1987
01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:02.380
(He must run the Han River Marathon.)

1988
01:19:03.279 --> 01:19:05.750
(Finally, it's a special resolution for Myeong Soo.)

1989
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:09.920
(He is re-enlisting into the army.)

1990
01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.619
(Congratulations on making rank.)

1991
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:15.960
(He has a fancy welcoming for himself.)

1992
01:19:16.859 --> 01:19:19.630
(It's a training situation that's very similar to real life.)

1993
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:23.100
(It's the ultimate 1 hour before.)

1994
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.569
(1 Hour Before)
