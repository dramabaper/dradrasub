1
00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:08.992
I didn't say this because we 
were in front of the kids.

2
00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:10.260
But what you did was...

3
00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:12.529
a premeditated crime.

4
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.364
How many times do I have to explain?

5
00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:15.866
I wasn't in my right mind then.

6
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.035
I went there out of anger.

7
00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:19.870
I couldn't do anything.

8
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.206
Don't lie. I heard
 everything from Tae Yang.

9
00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.409
You failed on your second try.

10
00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.512
You already took the respirator 
off much earlier.

11
00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:30.247
Did you think I wouldn't know?

12
00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:33.050
What? What do you mean?

13
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:35.819
When did I take the respirator off?

14
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.221
I just went to the hospital.

15
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.957
I ran away because Tae Yang saw me.

16
00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.526
I didn't do anything.

17
00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.327
Is that true?

18
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:48.899
I'm asking you.

19
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.901
Are you saying the truth?

20
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.036
Did you only go to the hospital...

21
00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:55.338
that one time when I found you?

22
00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:58.108
Yes, I don't know anything
 about the earlier incident.

23
00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.611
I swear that was my first time.

24
00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:05.148
That means the real culprit is another person.

25
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.318
Someone really tried...

26
00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.154
to kill father.

27
00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:14.825
Who could that be?

28
00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:18.028
Who tried to kill the chairman?

29
00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:19.963
There is someone.

30
00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:22.766
Only one person would do that.

31
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:36.646
I brought some sushi that you like.

32
00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:40.150
You went through a lot today. Eat this and cheer up.

33
00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:47.324
This is so dirty and cheap. I can't do this anymore.

34
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.460
16 percent of the shares belongs to Mom.

35
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.230
Why do I have to remain next to Dad and beg like a beggar?

36
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.932
I'm just going to give up the shares...

37
00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:57.934
and live luxuriously with Dad's money.

38
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.072
Have you forgotten what those shares mean?

39
00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:05.342
You wouldn't have those shares if your mom didn't die.

40
00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:07.744
And you want to give them up?

41
00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:10.213
What should I do then? The fight is already over.

42
00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.949
Mom left it in her will,

43
00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.751
but he didn't register me on his family register.

44
00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.387
How can I win his biological son?

45
00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:21.892
Until now, I could remain next to Dad by all means.

46
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.028
Dad won't care at all next time...

47
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.531
unless I die.

48
00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.568
I'm going to end things here to live. Do you understand?

49
00:02:35.272 --> 00:02:37.207
You will gain one thing if you end it here.

50
00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:39.676
But you will be able to gain 10 things if you wait a little longer.

51
00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:41.545
What side will you choose?

52
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.682
What power do you have to make that kind of magic happen?

53
00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:46.950
Not me.

54
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:49.553
We will make that happen.

55
00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:51.188
We?

56
00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:53.690
Who are you talking about?

57
00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:06.203
If Joo Ae Ri wants something more than marrying you,

58
00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:08.805
the chairman might be in danger.

59
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.547
Tell me who "We" are.

60
00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:18.748
You should never tell...

61
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.551
anyone about this.

62
00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:25.055
Do you think I'm stupid? Tell me, who is it?

63
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.924
Do you know that we received a large amount of money last year...

64
00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.626
because of redeemable convertible preference shares from...

65
00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.562
Goldman Partners when we established the Beijing branch?

66
00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:35.265
I heard that they took more than 30 percent of the shares.

67
00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:37.000
What about that?

68
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.735
If we don't list it by this year,

69
00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:41.638
we will have to repay that all at once.

70
00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:42.973
But there aren't any problems.

71
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.908
Beijing is holding out well.

72
00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:47.277
We're ranked number one among franchises in Korea.

73
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:48.645
That's right.

74
00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:51.548
There haven't been any problems yet.

75
00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:53.149
What are you talking about?

76
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.819
What do you mean by "yet"?

77
00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:00.156
Do you mean...

78
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.294
Are you crazy?

79
00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:06.563
The company will be ruined.

80
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.268
The company won't be ruined. Chairman Kevin will be.

81
00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:14.804
Just endure until then.

82
00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.106
You'll earn money...

83
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.642
and something more precious.

84
00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:21.611
More precious?

85
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.247
What is that?

86
00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.187
You'll get back what you lost three years ago.

87
00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:37.927
I was in doubt when Ru Ri told me that.

88
00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:41.998
Everything was too meticulous for one woman to carry out.

89
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.168
I'm sure that she has an accomplice.

90
00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:47.704
Shouldn't we tell your father about this right now?

91
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.006
Of course, we should.

92
00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:52.676
But we need definite proof first.

93
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.046
If there was someone who took the respirator off as you said,

94
00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:58.882
can't we check the security footage of the hospital?

95
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.550
The footage was erased last time, so I couldn't see it.

96
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.985
I'll check again.

97
00:05:03.186 --> 00:05:04.254
Okay.

98
00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:05.989
Tae Yang.

99
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:09.059
You're his only blood relation.

100
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.995
Stay by his side even if it's tough.

101
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.799
Tell me whenever you need my help.

102
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.676
You must have been waiting for a long time.

103
00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:30.380
It took me some time to find this place because I've never been here.

104
00:05:30.547 --> 00:05:34.184
I'm sorry to make you bring me tea when you're such a precious guest.

105
00:05:34.184 --> 00:05:35.418
It's okay.

106
00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:39.055
I didn't know what you liked, so I made some lotus leaf tea.

107
00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:40.857
I heard that it's good for insomnia.

108
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:42.759
Thank you.

109
00:05:45.195 --> 00:05:46.696
I asked you to come...

110
00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:50.166
to ask for your help.

111
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.237
Yes, I was also worried.

112
00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.307
You must have felt hurt today.

113
00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.610
It's all because of my shortcomings.

114
00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:04.681
I understand why Tae Yang wants to leave me.

115
00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:08.251
I only caused trouble for him instead of treating him well...

116
00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:11.121
when we met as father and son after 30 years.

117
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.758
But...

118
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.494
the reason why I can't abandon Ae Ri...

119
00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:20.697
isn't because I don't know what kind of person she is.

120
00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.367
I raised her like my own daughter for 20 years.

121
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:26.603
I can't dismiss her like this.

122
00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:30.240
I understand.

123
00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:34.377
It might be a one-sided love for me,

124
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:39.115
but I want to repay the debt I owe to her mom until the end.

125
00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:41.818
So...

126
00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:45.188
please persuade Tae Yang...

127
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.824
to come back to my side.

128
00:06:48.057 --> 00:06:51.127
Do you know that Manager Jung...

129
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:55.965
wondered who his real dad was and missed him since he was young?

130
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:02.439
Whenever his stepdad was mean to him,

131
00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.441
he would imagine everything about you.

132
00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:08.611
How could you live your whole life without knowing your real dad?

133
00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:11.247
There are some good parts.

134
00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:14.551
I can imagine the most amazing dad inside my head.

135
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.486
In the past,

136
00:07:16.486 --> 00:07:19.756
I imagined that my police neighbor in an awesome uniform was my dad.

137
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.259
My role model has changed recently though.

138
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.763
That role model was you.

139
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.102
He's always missed you in his heart.

140
00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:37.006
You don't know how happy he was when he found out who you were.

141
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:42.378
Because you are that dad, he won't leave you ever.

142
00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:45.682
Please trust him and wait a little bit longer.

143
00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:01.197
You're his only blood relation.

144
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.000
Stay by his side even if it's tough.

145
00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:41.437
I ran into you coincidentally

146
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:44.340
And you stole my heart then

147
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:49.178
I ran into you coincidentally

148
00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:53.016
And your eyes stole my heart then

149
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.657
Back then, wherever I went,

150
00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:05.562
college girls would chase after me.

151
00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:10.800
That was my heyday.

152
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:15.305
If it wasn't for Young Hye,

153
00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:21.444
I would be the DJ for that famous radio show, "Music Camp",

154
00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:23.446
not Bae Chul Soo.

155
00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:29.586
"Lee Shin Mo's Music Camp"...

156
00:09:29.953 --> 00:09:31.554
starts now.

157
00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:42.532
Hey, Dong Ki. What's up?

158
00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.100
You didn't forget today's meeting, right?

159
00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:46.569
Come to my clinic in the afternoon.

160
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:47.937
Meeting?

161
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.043
Let me meet Choi Dae Se or whatever her name is.

162
00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:56.646
Okay. Set up a date.

163
00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:02.352
Hong Young Hye. You're not the one on a roll.

164
00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:05.088
I'll be on a roll too from now on.

165
00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:08.224
Goodness.

166
00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:10.293
That was quick.

167
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:13.429
By the way, do you have her photo?

168
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.699
I ought to prepare myself before...

169
00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:19.702
I pass out from shock after seeing her.

170
00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:20.770
Don't worry.

171
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.640
She was pretty back then, so she aged beautifully.

172
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.809
Make sure you look presentable, so you don't disappoint her.

173
00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:30.046
Right. Leave your car since we're going to grab some drinks.

174
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.954
He's right. This is a reunion after 30 years.

175
00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:41.057
I ought to dress up today.

176
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.034
My gosh, look at my baby.

177
00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:53.836
With your tiny mouth,

178
00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:58.074
you're chewing your food like a cute squirrel.

179
00:10:58.174 --> 00:11:01.544
Here's the meat you love.

180
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:03.780
Mother, you should eat too.

181
00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:06.582
She's seven now. She can eat on her own.

182
00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:08.518
You'll understand it when you reach my age.

183
00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:11.154
Watching my baby eat...

184
00:11:11.154 --> 00:11:15.525
makes me happier than myself eating.

185
00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:16.926
Han Gyul.

186
00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:19.595
Let me ask you a question.

187
00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:22.799
Who is sitting next to you?

188
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:26.903
Yeon...

189
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.076
Mom. She's Han Gyul's mom.

190
00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:38.181
Good job, Han Gyul. Eat up.

191
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.016
Okay, Yeon Ju.

192
00:11:40.016 --> 00:11:44.320
My goodness. How could you be stupid?

193
00:11:44.554 --> 00:11:45.922
How many times did I tell you?

194
00:11:46.022 --> 00:11:49.425
If you take after your dad, you wouldn't repeat the same mistake.

195
00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:53.663
I'll scold you if you call her by her name again.

196
00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.065
I told you to forget about your past.

197
00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:57.200
Did you get that?

198
00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:01.704
You're louder than my grandfather.

199
00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:03.206
No, you're louder.

200
00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:05.441
Shut your mouth and eat up.

201
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.977
Mom, you're acting like a kid too.

202
00:12:08.444 --> 00:12:10.580
Han Gyul, if you're finished, go brush your teeth.

203
00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:13.683
Oh, my life.

204
00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:16.452
Gosh.

205
00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:21.290
After living with her grandfather, she talks like an old lady.

206
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:25.194
Hey, I'm doing this for your sake.

207
00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:30.099
The mothers at Han Gyul's kindergarten...

208
00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:34.303
are going to make a pack and start socializing.

209
00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:39.041
Imagine if they ostracize Han Gyul. It's going to hurt Han Gyul deeply.

210
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.910
Be careful, all right?

211
00:12:40.943 --> 00:12:42.645
That will never happen.

212
00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:46.315
That's why I chose a kindergarten that no one knows about.

213
00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:49.218
You should be careful not to slip out around your club members.

214
00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:52.855
Don't worry. I got rid of the past in my head.

215
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:03.933
Something smells delicious.

216
00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:08.070
Why are you making soup this morning?

217
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.639
I'm going to take some to work.

218
00:13:10.273 --> 00:13:12.074
Why? Is something sick?

219
00:13:12.675 --> 00:13:15.545
Yes, I heard my boss has stomach ulcer.

220
00:13:15.978 --> 00:13:18.714
He doesn't have any family. I felt bad for him.

221
00:13:18.948 --> 00:13:20.950
You're doing it because you feel bad, right?

222
00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.687
What does that mean?

223
00:13:25.188 --> 00:13:29.792
I mean, your boss bought you the car,

224
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.295
and now you're taking care of his health.

225
00:13:32.695 --> 00:13:34.931
I just think if you guys are going too far.

226
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:37.300
Why would you think that way?

227
00:13:37.433 --> 00:13:39.202
Where does the acorn fall?

228
00:13:39.702 --> 00:13:43.573
Your dad already threw a fit to make me return the car.

229
00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.441
- My gosh. - Did he?

230
00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:47.810
I actually thought he'd be upset if he found out.

231
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.946
Goodness, don't add fuel to the fire.

232
00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:52.315
Your dad did enough to upset me.

233
00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:54.317
Okay. I'll stop now.

234
00:13:54.817 --> 00:13:58.187
Right. The chairman wants to treat you guys to a meal.

235
00:13:58.187 --> 00:14:00.790
He asked me to see when you guys are free. When are you free?

236
00:14:00.957 --> 00:14:02.058
I don't know.

237
00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:04.327
I have to talk to your dad. Let me call him.

238
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.028
Okay.

239
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:33.055
Forget it, Young Hye.

240
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:35.057
Do you think you're the last woman on earth?

241
00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:40.162
I am going to meet a younger and prettier woman.

242
00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:42.231
So goodbye now.

243
00:14:57.179 --> 00:14:58.581
My skin is amazing.

244
00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:03.185
Shin Mo.

245
00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:09.625
My gosh. When does he clean?

246
00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:11.827
Why is it messy every time I come here?

247
00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:14.730
Shin Mo.

248
00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:18.200
Did he go somewhere this morning?

249
00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.412
- Shin Mo. - Why are you here?

250
00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:32.949
If you were fine, why didn't you answer my call?

251
00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:35.685
I rushed here because I was worried that you collapsed again.

252
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:39.055
Goodness. You wished that I was dead.

253
00:15:39.322 --> 00:15:42.291
Why? Are you here to collect the insurance money after I die?

254
00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.060
How could you say that to me?

255
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.796
Do you think I wanted to come here? I came because you didn't pick up.

256
00:15:47.964 --> 00:15:50.900
Chairman Kevin wants us to have a meal with him and his ex-wife.

257
00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:53.469
When are you free? The weekend is fine for you, right?

258
00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:57.707
No, starting this weekend, I'm going to be busy every weekend.

259
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:01.177
How could you be busy on weekends? You don't have a job.

260
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.313
Don't you know unemployed people die from working too much?

261
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.948
Goodness.

262
00:16:06.282 --> 00:16:09.819
I'll be so busy like the people who die from working too much.

263
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:11.153
Set it up on a Friday.

264
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.322
Why are you busy?

265
00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:16.158
My gosh, that's none of your concern.

266
00:16:16.158 --> 00:16:19.795
We graduated marriage. Why do you care?

267
00:16:19.795 --> 00:16:22.098
Get out. I told you to get out.

268
00:16:22.098 --> 00:16:24.033
I have to change. Come on. Out.

269
00:16:24.033 --> 00:16:26.669
Why are you still here? Do you want me to strip? Get out now.

270
00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:27.937
Get out right now.

271
00:16:29.538 --> 00:16:30.573
My gosh.

272
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.777
Seriously. What's gotten into him?

273
00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:37.413
He took off his pajama pants and showered.

274
00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:39.782
Is he going for a job interview?

275
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:48.324
Shin Mo.

276
00:16:50.292 --> 00:16:52.728
You looked down on me because I always wore...

277
00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:54.697
the pajama pants, yes?

278
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:58.701
I must look really good since you can't take your eyes off me.

279
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.473
- What is it? - Is that how you're going to dress?

280
00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:08.144
It's below 18°C today.

281
00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:11.714
If you dress lightly at your age, you'll have a stroke.

282
00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:15.351
Go back in and put on your winter jacket and hat.

283
00:17:15.351 --> 00:17:18.154
You should see them yourself. Old men at your age wear hats.

284
00:17:18.487 --> 00:17:21.357
Hey. I can't believe you.

285
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:23.826
How dare you call me old?

286
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.629
What do you mean I'm old? I don't look old at all.

287
00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:28.664
Don't you know people live until 100 now?

288
00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:32.234
If we were to compare our lives to time,

289
00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:35.137
it's only 6am at the age of 25.

290
00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:36.939
It's noon at the age of 50.

291
00:17:36.939 --> 00:17:40.376
And as for my age, it would be 3pm...

292
00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:41.944
which is the hottest time of the day.

293
00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:44.880
It's the peak of a man's life.

294
00:17:44.947 --> 00:17:48.184
How dare you tell me to wear a fur hat?

295
00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.351
Unbelievable.

296
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.953
Gosh.

297
00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:53.289
Don't you remember calling me a grandmother?

298
00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:56.225
I was just being considerate. Why are you reacting like that?

299
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:59.195
Young Hye, don't you think I know what you are thinking?

300
00:17:59.195 --> 00:18:01.697
It seems that you want to treat me like an old man...

301
00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:04.433
after going out a few times with your boss.

302
00:18:04.433 --> 00:18:07.169
But that's not going to happen.

303
00:18:07.203 --> 00:18:09.738
I'm popular.

304
00:18:09.738 --> 00:18:11.941
People want me to hang out with them.

305
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:14.210
And there are a lot of women who want to go on dates with me.

306
00:18:14.376 --> 00:18:17.847
It's not like I didn't cheat on you because I had no one.

307
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.417
There were so many other women, but I wanted to protect my family.

308
00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:24.653
I had to stab my thighs to stop myself.

309
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.424
Gosh, so are you saying that you're going on a date now?

310
00:18:28.624 --> 00:18:30.426
Yes, why not? Don't you think I can?

311
00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:32.361
There are women who want to go on dates with you?

312
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.763
I just hope you won't be conned by others.

313
00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.199
I don't care whatever you do with them.

314
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:40.035
Oh, my. Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

315
00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:42.271
I wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

316
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:46.609
Thank you for helping me get rid of any guilt I might have had.

317
00:18:47.476 --> 00:18:51.947
And this is not your house.

318
00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:55.151
Don't barge in like that.

319
00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:58.354
I have a right to privacy too.

320
00:18:58.354 --> 00:19:01.223
Imagine you barging in...

321
00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:03.425
when I'm with my girlfriend.

322
00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:06.395
Gosh, she would be so embarrassed.

323
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:08.731
Please respect my boundaries.

324
00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:12.935
And don't act like an ignorant woman.

325
00:19:15.371 --> 00:19:16.438
Gosh.

326
00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:20.342
How dare you think of bringing a woman here?

327
00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:24.713
Gosh. Oh my goodness.

328
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:27.416
Gosh, that man.

329
00:19:29.518 --> 00:19:30.619
What is this about?

330
00:19:32.488 --> 00:19:35.357
Is he really going out with someone?

331
00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.928
Gosh, who would be kind enough to accept him?

332
00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.963
Only I'd be kind enough to do that.

333
00:19:46.402 --> 00:19:47.937
He even put on his perfume.

334
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.673
That's a little strange.

335
00:19:55.244 --> 00:19:56.545
Hey.

336
00:19:57.146 --> 00:19:58.280
Where are we?

337
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:01.116
"Cafe 7080"?

338
00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:05.654
You said we were going to meet Theresa. Why did we come here?

339
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.489
She's waiting inside.

340
00:20:07.489 --> 00:20:08.991
Really?

341
00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:12.895
I thought we'd be having a meal.

342
00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:14.230
Are we drinking tea first?

343
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.665
Well, it would be a little strange to have a meal...

344
00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:19.201
when we're meeting for the first time in 30 years.

345
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:20.336
Right. Let's go inside.

346
00:20:20.336 --> 00:20:22.238
Wait.

347
00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:25.207
Do I look all right?

348
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:28.944
I feel so nervous.

349
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:30.346
Gosh.

350
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.514
You look fine,

351
00:20:33.115 --> 00:20:34.984
but your lips look a little blue.

352
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.619
It seems like you have a bad liver.

353
00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:38.254
You should get some medicine from my clinic.

354
00:20:38.254 --> 00:20:39.688
Shut it.

355
00:20:39.955 --> 00:20:42.925
I told you not to sell medicine to friends.

356
00:20:42.925 --> 00:20:45.494
- It's cold. Let's go inside. - Okay.

357
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.745
I've only heard of places like this.

358
00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:05.114
It's nice here.

359
00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:07.750
It reminds me of the old days.

360
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.253
After 8pm, this place overflows with people around our age.

361
00:21:11.253 --> 00:21:13.455
It's just like our college days.

362
00:21:19.828 --> 00:21:23.599
Is Therese one of them?

363
00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.101
She's not here yet.

364
00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:27.770
What a relief.

365
00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.773
When is she coming?

366
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.875
She should be here soon.

367
00:21:33.575 --> 00:21:35.344
- Should we order first? - Sure.

368
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:49.525
It's snowing

369
00:21:52.127 --> 00:21:56.131
After you left

370
00:21:56.832 --> 00:21:59.234
She's here. Look.

371
00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:03.205
It's snowing

372
00:22:05.874 --> 00:22:09.578
And I feel so lonely

373
00:22:12.848 --> 00:22:16.218
The warm smile

374
00:22:18.787 --> 00:22:22.624
That I've seen in my dreams

375
00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:27.329
Do you remember? She played the piano so well...

376
00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:29.198
that she got students' attention.

377
00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:38.340
I can't see it anymore

378
00:22:51.487 --> 00:22:55.724
It's snowing

379
00:22:58.894 --> 00:23:02.231
After you left

380
00:23:05.234 --> 00:23:08.971
It's snowing

381
00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:15.944
Shin Mo, when did you come here?

382
00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:20.916
I'm crying

383
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:28.891
- This lonely night - She hasn't changed a bit.

384
00:23:29.425 --> 00:23:32.795
- I am... - She was and still is...

385
00:23:32.795 --> 00:23:35.864
- A lonely girl - so adorable.

386
00:23:37.466 --> 00:23:39.001
How are you feeling?

387
00:23:39.268 --> 00:23:41.403
Does your stomach still hurt?

388
00:23:41.403 --> 00:23:42.738
Young Hye.

389
00:23:44.773 --> 00:23:47.609
It was a good idea to listen to you. I'm feeling much better.

390
00:23:49.077 --> 00:23:52.614
I needed to go to the office to send...

391
00:23:52.614 --> 00:23:55.784
some documents to Kazakhstan, but I forgot.

392
00:23:57.286 --> 00:23:59.455
Come here for a moment.

393
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:00.923
All right.

394
00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:05.694
Here.

395
00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:10.933
It's soup I made with tomato and cabbage this morning.

396
00:24:11.266 --> 00:24:13.936
I don't think I can eat anything now.

397
00:24:13.936 --> 00:24:16.872
You should take it and eat it later.

398
00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:18.440
It's not good to work on an empty stomach.

399
00:24:18.607 --> 00:24:20.609
You shouldn't be so nice to me.

400
00:24:22.411 --> 00:24:25.781
I might end up falling in love.

401
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.856
Do you want to visit Deoksu Palace?

402
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.725
Well, no.

403
00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:40.696
My dream was to become a city curator...

404
00:24:41.096 --> 00:24:43.432
after my children had all grown up.

405
00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:45.934
I have the certificate,

406
00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:48.103
but I didn't have a chance to actually become one.

407
00:24:48.103 --> 00:24:51.640
But I still want to become one, so I study these books constantly.

408
00:24:52.207 --> 00:24:54.910
That's why you shine so bright.

409
00:24:55.344 --> 00:24:57.846
They say that people with dreams don't age at all.

410
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:00.315
Thank you.

411
00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:03.352
Thank you for the soup.

412
00:25:03.352 --> 00:25:04.453
Sure.

413
00:25:18.033 --> 00:25:19.334
So Hee.

414
00:25:19.334 --> 00:25:22.638
Please wrap up some of the new women's golf wears.

415
00:25:22.638 --> 00:25:23.939
Are these presents?

416
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:27.276
I'm going to give some presents to mothers at Han Gyul's kindergarten.

417
00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:30.145
They're really stylish, so I need you to pick the best ones.

418
00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:31.446
Sure.

419
00:25:31.647 --> 00:25:33.916
Han Gyul must be so happy.

420
00:25:34.016 --> 00:25:37.786
She used to like you so much, following you everywhere.

421
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:39.454
And now, you're her mother.

422
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:44.026
Song Yi, this will be the first and the last time I say this to you.

423
00:25:44.526 --> 00:25:47.729
I want to raise Han Gyul as if she were my real child.

424
00:25:47.729 --> 00:25:51.099
Don't ever talk to me about what happened in the past.

425
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:53.535
Nor should you tell anyone else about it.

426
00:25:53.702 --> 00:25:54.903
Do you understand?

427
00:25:55.437 --> 00:25:58.040
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

428
00:26:03.345 --> 00:26:05.447
Do I need to change my employees?

429
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:12.854
But Mom is right.

430
00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:14.790
I should be strict...

431
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.892
to be her only mom.

432
00:26:16.892 --> 00:26:20.796
That way, you, Han Gyul, and I won't be hurt.

433
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.839
Sir, Mrs. Yang is here.

434
00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:37.179
My son-in-law, Doctor Lee.

435
00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:39.181
Did you have lunch?

436
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:40.248
What brings you here?

437
00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:43.185
What do you think? It's part of the housekeeping.

438
00:26:43.986 --> 00:26:47.623
My knees hurt, probably because...

439
00:26:47.623 --> 00:26:49.358
of the weather.

440
00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:52.027
I thought I could use some injections to the knee.

441
00:26:52.628 --> 00:26:54.363
- Please bring us tea. - Yes, sir.

442
00:26:55.163 --> 00:26:56.398
Take a seat.

443
00:27:01.403 --> 00:27:02.871
Does it hurt a lot?

444
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.373
It aches.

445
00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:11.413
It's not too bad yet. You should take injections later.

446
00:27:12.014 --> 00:27:15.917
In fact, my knees were just an excuse.

447
00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:19.488
You must have felt a little upset this morning.

448
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.027
I was going to talk to you about that.

449
00:27:26.928 --> 00:27:31.099
Mother, wounds don't heal if we only try to cover them up.

450
00:27:31.967 --> 00:27:35.837
Even if they hurt, we must disinfect them and expose them to the sun,

451
00:27:36.038 --> 00:27:38.273
so that a scab would form around the wounds and heal properly.

452
00:27:38.273 --> 00:27:41.777
Gosh, are you teaching me a medical lesson?

453
00:27:41.777 --> 00:27:43.545
Gosh.

454
00:27:43.545 --> 00:27:46.081
I'll get some laser treatments in the next room.

455
00:27:46.114 --> 00:27:47.516
This isn't right.

456
00:27:47.983 --> 00:27:49.618
Both Yeon Ju and You are making a mistake.

457
00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:52.287
What are you talking about?

458
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:54.690
Are you a judge?

459
00:27:54.956 --> 00:27:56.358
Did you say that his name was "Ha Eun Jo"?

460
00:27:57.392 --> 00:28:01.363
Why did you never try to find him?

461
00:28:01.997 --> 00:28:04.199
What do you want to know?

462
00:28:04.199 --> 00:28:06.168
Are you afraid that he'd have gone wrong?

463
00:28:07.235 --> 00:28:09.204
That people would say that everything is your fault?

464
00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:12.174
You didn't try to find him because you were afraid to face...

465
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:14.176
your fault from the past, right?

466
00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:15.944
Be quiet.

467
00:28:16.378 --> 00:28:17.913
Can't you shut your mouth?

468
00:28:18.246 --> 00:28:22.884
How would you know how I feel to talk about that kind of nonsense?

469
00:28:23.485 --> 00:28:25.754
When his father was alive,

470
00:28:25.887 --> 00:28:29.257
he used up half of that vast fortune to find...

471
00:28:29.391 --> 00:28:32.694
him from every corner of Korea.

472
00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:34.830
There wasn't a single piece of good news then.

473
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.332
It's certain that he's not alive.

474
00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:40.535
What use is there to try to find him now?

475
00:28:40.535 --> 00:28:43.171
Why are you causing pain in my heart?

476
00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:45.107
That's an excuse.

477
00:28:47.442 --> 00:28:50.479
Everyone makes mistakes in life.

478
00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:54.015
How you handle that mistake is what's important.

479
00:28:54.916 --> 00:28:55.984
Please.

480
00:28:57.085 --> 00:28:58.153
Let go of me.

481
00:28:59.187 --> 00:29:00.422
What is wrong with you?

482
00:29:00.856 --> 00:29:02.858
Have you lost fear of me...

483
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:05.393
just because I accepted your child...

484
00:29:05.527 --> 00:29:07.529
and let you reunite with Yeon Ju?

485
00:29:07.529 --> 00:29:09.664
Are you looking down at me because of that?

486
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.901
What is your purpose of doing this?

487
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:16.004
It's because Yeon Ju is taking the same path as yours.

488
00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:20.876
Everyone knows why we divorced and reunited.

489
00:29:21.343 --> 00:29:24.446
The truth won't disappear from cutting them out of our lives.

490
00:29:24.613 --> 00:29:27.449
Why is the truth important?

491
00:29:27.449 --> 00:29:29.184
My daughter and your daughter...

492
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:31.720
are what is important to me.

493
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.723
It's important to me that your daughter live a happy life.

494
00:29:34.723 --> 00:29:35.891
I already told you.

495
00:29:36.224 --> 00:29:38.260
If we cover a wound just because it hurts now,

496
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.729
it will fester, and we won't be able to treat it later.

497
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.931
Do you want that to happen?

498
00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:46.234
Do you know how people pointed at Yeon Ju when she was young...

499
00:29:46.468 --> 00:29:49.871
because she didn't have a father?

500
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:53.341
She would always cry when she came back from school.

501
00:29:53.441 --> 00:29:55.610
Do you know what I told her?

502
00:29:55.844 --> 00:30:01.016
"Yeon Ju, your father is on a different level..."

503
00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.384
"than the father of your friends."

504
00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:06.254
"He went to America to receive a doctorate."

505
00:30:06.254 --> 00:30:09.157
"Be proud and brag about it."

506
00:30:09.324 --> 00:30:12.027
That's why she wasn't disheartened.

507
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.131
Life and death depend on one's words.

508
00:30:16.198 --> 00:30:18.433
Why would you reveal that...

509
00:30:18.433 --> 00:30:20.669
and bother people?

510
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:22.437
Why would you reveal that?

511
00:30:22.704 --> 00:30:23.872
Mother.

512
00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:25.674
So Won.

513
00:30:27.442 --> 00:30:28.710
Mom's right.

514
00:30:28.844 --> 00:30:31.980
I don't think I can stand people talking behind our backs.

515
00:30:32.347 --> 00:30:33.849
There can be rumors.

516
00:30:33.849 --> 00:30:35.517
But as long as we don't acknowledge them,

517
00:30:35.884 --> 00:30:37.519
they will just end as rumors.

518
00:30:38.353 --> 00:30:41.156
Please give up this time.

519
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:45.994
You have a long way to go to become a father.

520
00:30:46.528 --> 00:30:49.831
To be a parent, you have to go some steps ahead...

521
00:30:50.198 --> 00:30:53.935
to clean up the pebbles in front of your children's way.

522
00:30:54.336 --> 00:30:56.104
That's what parents are like.

523
00:30:56.638 --> 00:30:59.507
Because of this rumor, we are scared of other people.

524
00:30:59.507 --> 00:31:03.345
But we're more scared about seeing our child getting hurt.

525
00:31:03.745 --> 00:31:05.747
You should just be quiet.

526
00:31:05.881 --> 00:31:09.150
I'll take care of the pebbles.

527
00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:10.986
Just be quiet.

528
00:31:11.186 --> 00:31:12.754
Don't say anything.

529
00:31:12.754 --> 00:31:14.990
Stop causing me pain with your words.

530
00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:26.401
I'm going to find Ha Eun Jo.

531
00:31:28.703 --> 00:31:29.871
So Won.

532
00:31:30.939 --> 00:31:32.507
Don't tell your mother.

533
00:31:33.608 --> 00:31:36.144
Her thoughts will change when she meets him.

534
00:31:38.446 --> 00:31:41.283
I'll take care of everything, okay?

535
00:31:43.218 --> 00:31:44.686
There's no use of finding him.

536
00:31:45.186 --> 00:31:47.389
Mom considers him dead.

537
00:31:50.091 --> 00:31:52.193
You know why I'm doing this, don't you?

538
00:31:54.963 --> 00:31:57.098
I don't want you to make the same mistake like her.

539
00:31:58.733 --> 00:31:59.901
The truth won't disappear...

540
00:32:01.202 --> 00:32:02.671
just because you look away.

541
00:32:04.372 --> 00:32:05.540
So Won.

542
00:32:06.274 --> 00:32:09.911
I'm sure that Han Gyul and you will get hurt like this.

543
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.280
You had such a hard time because of me.

544
00:32:13.715 --> 00:32:17.185
I really don't want you to get hurt anymore.

545
00:32:17.852 --> 00:32:20.855
I'm not the old Ha Yeon Ju.

546
00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:24.259
I chose to be strong the moment I decided to accept Han Gyul.

547
00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:27.495
As long as you're by my side,

548
00:32:27.996 --> 00:32:30.899
I'll even be thankful for that pain.

549
00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:05.166
- Mom. - Mom.

550
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.603
Did you have fun today?

551
00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:12.173
- How was school today? - You're here.

552
00:33:12.173 --> 00:33:13.441
You're so pretty.

553
00:33:13.842 --> 00:33:16.344
- You're so pretty today. - You're flattering her.

554
00:33:16.945 --> 00:33:19.948
Are you the mothers of class rose?

555
00:33:20.115 --> 00:33:21.916
I'm Han Gyul's mom, the new student.

556
00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:23.685
I'm a little late to introduce myself.

557
00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:27.422
I'd like to offer you some tea if you have the time.

558
00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:29.424
Really?

559
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:31.526
We were about to get some tea.

560
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.927
Follow us.

561
00:33:33.294 --> 00:33:35.096
- Let's go. - Okay.

562
00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:36.831
Han Gyul, let's go.

563
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.440
I'll order 4 americanos and 4 of each kind of cake.

564
00:33:48.877 --> 00:33:50.045
That will be 50 dollars.

565
00:33:56.484 --> 00:33:59.554
Mom, Do Yoon made this for me.

566
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:01.423
Really?

567
00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:04.426
Han Gyul, I'm going to talk with other moms.

568
00:34:04.426 --> 00:34:06.127
Go and have fun with your friends.

569
00:34:06.127 --> 00:34:07.495
Okay, mom.

570
00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:13.034
I'll bring you the cakes.

571
00:34:13.168 --> 00:34:14.436
Yes, thank you.

572
00:34:26.448 --> 00:34:27.515
Put it here.

573
00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:31.186
Stop there.

574
00:34:31.786 --> 00:34:32.887
It's mine.

575
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:37.659
Han Gyul grabbed it first.

576
00:34:37.725 --> 00:34:40.995
When did you start being on Han Gyul's side?

577
00:34:43.364 --> 00:34:45.767
Here. Take this and be quiet.

578
00:34:46.034 --> 00:34:48.636
You shouldn't fight with your friends.

579
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.706
I don't need it. I'm not a beggar.

580
00:34:51.806 --> 00:34:53.475
I'll take it then.

581
00:35:05.887 --> 00:35:07.155
Chun Ok!

582
00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:09.724
Chun Ok!

583
00:35:12.227 --> 00:35:13.595
Chun Ok!

584
00:35:14.229 --> 00:35:16.164
What am I going to do?

585
00:35:16.464 --> 00:35:18.833
Chun Ok!

586
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.004
Eun Jo.

587
00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:28.409
How hard did you try to find me that night?

588
00:35:30.478 --> 00:35:33.248
There weren't any rumors of you getting hit by a train.

589
00:35:34.082 --> 00:35:35.183
I'm sorry.

590
00:35:36.117 --> 00:35:37.619
I'm a wicked person.

591
00:35:39.254 --> 00:35:40.388
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:50.198
Mother, haven't you left yet?

593
00:35:51.766 --> 00:35:54.702
Yes, I came back...

594
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.538
because I was upset.

595
00:35:56.905 --> 00:36:00.141
I'm sorry. I was a little harsh earlier.

596
00:36:00.542 --> 00:36:03.578
No, you were right.

597
00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:06.347
To be honest,

598
00:36:07.615 --> 00:36:10.685
I haven't been able to sleep well at nights for the whole time.

599
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:13.388
I sometimes have nightmares...

600
00:36:14.656 --> 00:36:16.724
thinking something bad might've happened to him.

601
00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:21.062
I had such a hard time.

602
00:36:22.063 --> 00:36:23.164
Mother.

603
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.408
Try to find him.

604
00:36:35.143 --> 00:36:37.445
If something bad happened to him,

605
00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:40.582
I'm going to take care of him.

606
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:45.286
Okay, I'll do my best to find him.

607
00:36:48.389 --> 00:36:49.824
People say that if it will happen...

608
00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:52.994
if it's meant to be.

609
00:36:54.562 --> 00:36:56.764
We will meet if it's meant to be.

610
00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:11.679
Did you say your child's name was Han Gyul?

611
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.681
Yes, it's Lee Han Gyul.

612
00:37:13.948 --> 00:37:17.385
It's her first time in preschool. Please help her.

613
00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:18.753
Is it her first time?

614
00:37:19.387 --> 00:37:21.889
What kind of gifted education did she receive before this?

615
00:37:22.457 --> 00:37:24.926
What? Gifted education?

616
00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:27.829
Where did she receive her education?

617
00:37:28.763 --> 00:37:31.099
No, I didn't do anything.

618
00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:34.902
What? You didn't do anything?

619
00:37:36.304 --> 00:37:39.774
How could you not let your child do anything and neglect her?

620
00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:44.212
You must have been overseas with her dad, right?

621
00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:49.017
Yes, that's right. We were in America.

622
00:37:50.618 --> 00:37:52.887
She must've mastered English.

623
00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:54.555
I'm envious.

624
00:37:54.889 --> 00:37:57.825
She's still young.

625
00:37:58.159 --> 00:38:01.696
Oh, right. I've brought holiday presents.

626
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:02.864
One second.

627
00:38:06.134 --> 00:38:07.235
Here.

628
00:38:09.504 --> 00:38:12.707
This is for Do Yoon's mom, and it's for Se Ra's mom.

629
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.480
It's golf wear. I'm not sure if you'll like it.

630
00:38:23.785 --> 00:38:25.186
Thank you.

631
00:38:25.453 --> 00:38:26.688
Thank you.

632
00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.195
Enjoy.

633
00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:37.832
Mom. Han Gyul's so annoying.

634
00:38:38.499 --> 00:38:41.436
Se Ra. You shouldn't say that to your friend.

635
00:38:41.436 --> 00:38:43.404
No. She's really annoying.

636
00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:46.407
She doesn't share the toy blocks.

637
00:38:46.808 --> 00:38:49.477
I'm never going to play with her again.

638
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.453
I'm sorry.

639
00:38:58.453 --> 00:39:01.022
She's still not used to a group life.

640
00:39:01.022 --> 00:39:02.724
I'll warn her.

641
00:39:03.324 --> 00:39:05.960
Children can have a fight.

642
00:39:06.294 --> 00:39:07.995
Don't yell at her too much.

643
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.204
- Great. - Great.

644
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:20.641
I just bought this. Who wants to play this with me?

645
00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:22.210
- Me. - Me.

646
00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:24.345
Me too.

647
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.849
Can I join you?

648
00:39:28.182 --> 00:39:30.985
You have no cards. Go away.

649
00:39:36.224 --> 00:39:38.326
Idiot.

650
00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:48.503
Long time no see.

651
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.542
You're wearing something so expensive.

652
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.445
You know you should thank me for it, right?

653
00:39:58.746 --> 00:40:01.349
Han Gyul. Where's your mom?

654
00:40:03.117 --> 00:40:05.019
It's fine. Tell me.

655
00:40:05.019 --> 00:40:07.255
My mom's not here.

656
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.063
I'm still new to education.

657
00:40:16.063 --> 00:40:19.333
If you know any good program, let me join you too.

658
00:40:19.367 --> 00:40:22.637
Okay. We're going to the US to study English in June.

659
00:40:22.637 --> 00:40:24.405
Apply for it if there's still a room left.

660
00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:27.208
You apply for June program already?

661
00:40:27.809 --> 00:40:29.844
You're so strange.

662
00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:32.613
How can you be so ignorant?

663
00:40:36.384 --> 00:40:39.787
Mom. Let's go home. Now.

664
00:40:39.787 --> 00:40:44.058
Han Gyul. I'm talking to your friends' moms right now.

665
00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:47.995
No. Let's go home, Mom. Hurry up.

666
00:40:48.596 --> 00:40:50.164
What's wrong with her?

667
00:40:50.598 --> 00:40:51.866
Okay.

668
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.037
I'm sorry. I'll leave first.

669
00:40:56.604 --> 00:40:58.039
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:58.105 --> 00:40:59.974
Let's go, Han Gyul.

671
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:01.742
Let's go.

672
00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:04.812
What's wrong?

673
00:41:15.156 --> 00:41:17.058
Awesome.

674
00:41:23.264 --> 00:41:27.602
Myung Rang. What does the cow say in the first meeting?

675
00:41:27.602 --> 00:41:28.703
Nice to meet you.

676
00:41:29.504 --> 00:41:33.140
Then what medicine do chicks take?

677
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.275
Cheep.

678
00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:37.478
That's enough. You don't need to practice old jokes anymore.

679
00:41:37.845 --> 00:41:40.114
I postponed the meeting with my dad.

680
00:41:40.114 --> 00:41:41.782
Why?

681
00:41:41.782 --> 00:41:44.185
I told my dad you're the eldest son,

682
00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:46.153
and he said he never wants to see you.

683
00:41:47.054 --> 00:41:48.956
Getting pregnant is the only way.

684
00:41:48.956 --> 00:41:52.560
No. How can we do that before getting married?

685
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.563
What do you mean? Would you rather want to break up then?

686
00:41:55.563 --> 00:41:57.765
No. It's not that.

687
00:41:58.199 --> 00:42:02.136
Anyway, I want to protect you.

688
00:42:02.136 --> 00:42:05.540
You know saving up will make it go to a waste.

689
00:42:07.475 --> 00:42:10.411
Joo Ae Ri took medicine and put on a suicidal show.

690
00:42:10.411 --> 00:42:12.246
When would Ru Ri come back to work?

691
00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:16.617
I know. Joo Ae Ri is so disgusting.

692
00:42:17.518 --> 00:42:20.288
By the way, Manager Jung's not here either.

693
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:22.657
I'm not sure what's going to happen to the company.

694
00:42:32.867 --> 00:42:35.269
Persuade Tae Yang so that...

695
00:42:35.603 --> 00:42:37.305
he'd come back to me.

696
00:42:47.081 --> 00:42:48.950
You look so pale.

697
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.586
Were you not able to sleep again?

698
00:42:53.854 --> 00:42:56.424
I wanted to see you because I have something important to say.

699
00:42:56.791 --> 00:42:59.160
That's good. I have something important too.

700
00:42:59.594 --> 00:43:02.663
Actually I met Chairman Kevin yesterday.

701
00:43:02.763 --> 00:43:05.232
He asked me to make you...

702
00:43:05.232 --> 00:43:07.435
go back to him.

703
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.575
So let's start going to work with me from tomorrow.

704
00:43:15.209 --> 00:43:17.345
I can't wait to go back to work.

705
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.482
Ru Ri. Listen to me.

706
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:24.085
Don't go to work for a while.

707
00:43:24.452 --> 00:43:25.953
Get ready for the wedding at home.

708
00:43:26.253 --> 00:43:28.556
Get ready for the wedding? Come on.

709
00:43:28.823 --> 00:43:32.093
Do you expect me to buy a lot because you have a rich father?

710
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.329
I can't because I don't have any money.

711
00:43:35.463 --> 00:43:39.367
I'll work instead. So let's go to work.

712
00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:42.903
I'm not joking. Do as I said.

713
00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:45.306
Stay away from the company for a while.

714
00:43:46.273 --> 00:43:49.076
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

715
00:43:52.346 --> 00:43:53.848
What's going on?

716
00:43:56.484 --> 00:43:57.785
Nothing.

717
00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:00.454
I just want you to relax.

718
00:44:00.454 --> 00:44:02.156
Don't lie.

719
00:44:02.189 --> 00:44:05.292
What's going on? Did Joo Ae Ri do something again?

720
00:44:07.194 --> 00:44:08.963
Tell me.

721
00:44:09.096 --> 00:44:11.265
I can tell by looking at your eyes.

722
00:44:11.265 --> 00:44:14.035
Don't try to solve it yourself. Tell me.

723
00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:16.537
You'll be in danger if you stay with me.

724
00:44:17.638 --> 00:44:20.074
- So... - Do you think I didn't think...

725
00:44:20.074 --> 00:44:21.976
about such thing when I decided to marry you?

726
00:44:22.843 --> 00:44:25.046
Hurry up and tell me. What is it?

727
00:44:32.053 --> 00:44:35.189
It's recorded over a few times. It might not be easy to restore.

728
00:44:35.189 --> 00:44:37.224
I'm well aware. Thank you.

729
00:44:47.368 --> 00:44:49.036
It's Hankuk Hospital Security Office.

730
00:44:49.203 --> 00:44:52.206
You told me to call you if anyone asks for CCTV footage.

731
00:44:52.673 --> 00:44:55.309
Someone just came by.

732
00:44:56.177 --> 00:44:57.478
Someone came by?

733
00:44:57.478 --> 00:45:00.748
The young man who came with you.

734
00:45:01.682 --> 00:45:04.485
Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

735
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:09.724
Why does Jung Tae Yang want to go through it again?

736
00:45:10.658 --> 00:45:13.294
Did he realize Go Jung Do is not the one?

737
00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:22.636
Mr. Kim. Where are you?

738
00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:25.573
Come to Hankuk Hospital immediately. Right now.

739
00:45:27.875 --> 00:45:29.577
Once I restore this hard drive,

740
00:45:29.643 --> 00:45:32.713
we can check the CCTV footage.

741
00:45:32.713 --> 00:45:36.250
We can check who pulled off the respirator that night.

742
00:45:36.884 --> 00:45:38.953
Do you have anyone suspicious?

743
00:45:39.687 --> 00:45:41.388
It's probably Joo Ae Ri.

744
00:45:41.756 --> 00:45:44.058
I think there's someone behind her.

745
00:45:44.892 --> 00:45:48.295
I'm going to try my best to find it out.

746
00:45:48.295 --> 00:45:50.998
It's probably someone from the company.

747
00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:54.935
Someone who can visit the chairman's room frequently.

748
00:45:55.202 --> 00:45:58.873
That also includes Director Park.

749
00:46:00.207 --> 00:46:01.976
I hope it's not him.

750
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.813
If Director Park betrayed my father,

751
00:46:07.014 --> 00:46:08.516
my father would be so sad.

752
00:46:13.788 --> 00:46:14.789
Let's go.

753
00:46:14.955 --> 00:46:16.157
One second.

754
00:46:16.724 --> 00:46:19.593
We might not able to restore it.

755
00:46:19.593 --> 00:46:23.097
I'll go meet the nurse I talked to before.

756
00:46:23.097 --> 00:46:25.432
I'll go look for a witness just in case.

757
00:46:25.766 --> 00:46:26.934
See you later.

758
00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:28.435
Ru Ri.

759
00:46:30.504 --> 00:46:31.605
Thank you.

760
00:46:32.306 --> 00:46:33.774
I'd be so lonely right now...

761
00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:36.243
if I hadn't met you.

762
00:46:38.946 --> 00:46:41.248
You can thank me later.

763
00:46:42.016 --> 00:46:43.117
Bye.

764
00:47:17.885 --> 00:47:20.754
Jung Tae Yang has the hard drive with hospital CCTV footage in it.

765
00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:22.523
We need to stop him by all means.

766
00:47:50.251 --> 00:47:52.620
I'm sorry for asking you to meet me. You must be busy.

767
00:47:52.786 --> 00:47:54.788
It's all right. What is it you want to ask me?

768
00:47:55.055 --> 00:47:57.558
Do you remember...

769
00:47:57.892 --> 00:48:00.794
Chairman Kevin who was hospitalized three months ago?

770
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:04.765
Of course. Did something happen to him?

771
00:48:04.832 --> 00:48:05.933
No.

772
00:48:06.533 --> 00:48:08.769
I heard you told his son...

773
00:48:09.503 --> 00:48:13.307
that someone had disconnected his respirator on purpose.

774
00:48:13.707 --> 00:48:15.809
I wanted to know if anyone had seen the culprit.

775
00:48:16.176 --> 00:48:19.847
I said this before, but no one had witnessed it.

776
00:48:22.116 --> 00:48:23.851
I'm really sorry,

777
00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:26.453
but can you look into this again?

778
00:48:27.054 --> 00:48:29.556
This is a serious problem.

779
00:48:30.424 --> 00:48:31.525
All right.

780
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:35.062
I'll check the shift records.

781
00:48:35.596 --> 00:48:36.764
Thank you.

782
00:48:37.097 --> 00:48:41.335
It happened around 10pm on November 15.

783
00:48:41.735 --> 00:48:44.305
Please check if there were any witnesses.

784
00:48:50.744 --> 00:48:53.814
I'm at Myung Seong Studio Apartment.

785
00:48:53.914 --> 00:48:55.516
What floor are you on?

786
00:49:02.823 --> 00:49:03.891
(Myung Seong Studio Apartment)

787
00:49:22.076 --> 00:49:23.477
(Myung Seong Studio Apartment)

788
00:49:32.786 --> 00:49:34.455
I can't be sure of this,

789
00:49:34.855 --> 00:49:37.658
but there aren't any external damages. I'll try to restore it.

790
00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:39.727
How long will this take?

791
00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:42.496
I need to open this up to know, but it will take at least 2 to 3 days.

792
00:49:45.432 --> 00:49:47.001
This is very important, so take very good care of it.

793
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.035
What are you doing?

794
00:50:21.535 --> 00:50:24.438
It's been 30 years. There must be a lot to talk about.

795
00:50:24.705 --> 00:50:26.273
Why aren't you saying anything?

796
00:50:26.807 --> 00:50:28.275
You're 60 years old. Don't be shy.

797
00:50:30.978 --> 00:50:34.581
Theresa, why did you want to see me?

798
00:50:36.183 --> 00:50:39.153
You didn't know that you were my first love, did you?

799
00:50:41.655 --> 00:50:43.824
I had kept it a secret.

800
00:50:44.658 --> 00:50:47.161
And you got married before I got the chance to tell you.

801
00:50:49.096 --> 00:50:50.197
Really?

802
00:50:51.432 --> 00:50:52.766
Thanks...

803
00:50:53.267 --> 00:50:54.601
for meeting me like this.

804
00:50:55.369 --> 00:50:58.705
You must have a happy marriage.

805
00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:00.174
Do you have kids?

806
00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:03.710
Sure, his life has been wonderful.

807
00:51:03.944 --> 00:51:07.414
He made it to Director at Sae Gi Construction and resigned last year.

808
00:51:07.681 --> 00:51:10.517
His son is a doctor, and his daughter is dating a rich man.

809
00:51:10.684 --> 00:51:12.019
But he graduated marriage, so...

810
00:51:12.019 --> 00:51:15.389
- Hey, stop it right there. - All right.

811
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:18.225
How have you been?

812
00:51:18.792 --> 00:51:20.427
You must have had a happy life.

813
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:25.232
Of course. I did.

814
00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:30.938
Shin Mo, to congratulate ourselves on having had wonderful lives,

815
00:51:30.938 --> 00:51:32.473
we should sing together.

816
00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.909
Yes, you should show off your singing skills.

817
00:51:35.909 --> 00:51:38.345
Gosh, I shouldn't sing.

818
00:51:38.479 --> 00:51:41.748
I haven't sung for ages. I shouldn't.

819
00:51:41.748 --> 00:51:44.384
- Gosh, go on. - I shouldn't.

820
00:51:54.962 --> 00:51:56.497
I have a right to privacy too.

821
00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.533
Imagine you barging in...

822
00:51:59.766 --> 00:52:01.735
when I'm with my girlfriend.

823
00:52:01.935 --> 00:52:04.037
Gosh, she would be so embarrassed.

824
00:52:05.639 --> 00:52:08.809
It can't be.

825
00:52:21.755 --> 00:52:23.223
This is strange.

826
00:52:24.458 --> 00:52:26.994
Why isn't he picking up his phone?

827
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:33.133
Don't hold yourself back

828
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:36.904
Don't hide your love

829
00:52:37.771 --> 00:52:40.908
Don't ignore it

830
00:52:41.308 --> 00:52:44.144
It will only hurt you

831
00:52:44.978 --> 00:52:47.714
Life is about

832
00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:52.186
Holding yourself back

833
00:52:52.186 --> 00:52:55.556
But I guess I can be a little greedy

834
00:52:55.889 --> 00:52:59.092
Everyone lives like that too

835
00:53:01.962 --> 00:53:03.830
(Lee Shin Mo)

836
00:53:09.536 --> 00:53:11.538
(Lee Shin Mo)

837
00:53:15.042 --> 00:53:17.211
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

838
00:53:18.178 --> 00:53:19.813
Is he really dating someone?

839
00:53:21.248 --> 00:53:23.884
Gosh, I don't care whatever he does.

840
00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:26.186
People might think I'm being jealous.

841
00:53:28.155 --> 00:53:31.558
But what if he ruins everything before Ru Ri's marriage...

842
00:53:32.426 --> 00:53:35.295
by causing troubles like this?

843
00:53:36.697 --> 00:53:37.831
Gosh.

844
00:53:46.406 --> 00:53:48.075
I had fun today.

845
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.248
You've always been so handsome.

846
00:53:58.752 --> 00:54:00.020
Oh, my.

847
00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:03.557
See you next time.

848
00:54:04.224 --> 00:54:06.159
- Sure. - You promised.

849
00:54:08.228 --> 00:54:09.329
Oh, my.

850
00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:36.323
Why... Why are you here?

851
00:54:37.457 --> 00:54:38.558
Who's that?

852
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:44.264
Who... Who... Who are you talking about?

853
00:54:44.498 --> 00:54:47.434
Who's the woman who drove you home?

854
00:54:49.503 --> 00:54:50.604
It's none of your business.

855
00:54:50.904 --> 00:54:52.439
The contract clearly says...

856
00:54:53.073 --> 00:54:56.343
that we shouldn't care about each other's dating life.

857
00:54:56.977 --> 00:55:01.014
I won't say anything even if your boss drinks tea with you,

858
00:55:01.248 --> 00:55:02.616
drives you home,

859
00:55:02.783 --> 00:55:05.352
or gives you a car.

860
00:55:05.786 --> 00:55:09.556
So you shouldn't pay attention to my private life either.

861
00:55:11.124 --> 00:55:13.927
We only live once

862
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:17.464
It's a world we live in

863
00:55:18.832 --> 00:55:20.767
Has he gone crazy?

864
00:55:21.435 --> 00:55:22.536
Gosh.

865
00:55:25.772 --> 00:55:27.574
She's young and pretty though.

866
00:55:28.075 --> 00:55:29.409
It makes me feel bad.

867
00:55:34.614 --> 00:55:37.351
I have a granddaughter.

868
00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:42.823
She will inherit my wealth.

869
00:55:46.827 --> 00:55:48.662
I am...

870
00:55:48.662 --> 00:55:50.731
Hey, stop.

871
00:55:53.867 --> 00:55:56.937
Are you taking these fruits upstairs?

872
00:55:56.937 --> 00:56:00.574
Yes, it's dessert for Doctor Lee and Yeon Ju.

873
00:56:00.974 --> 00:56:04.578
I know you're smart, but you have no wit.

874
00:56:04.578 --> 00:56:07.347
They're burning up with love.

875
00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:10.450
You shouldn't interrupt them with this.

876
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:12.652
Give it to me. I'll leave it upstairs quietly.

877
00:56:12.652 --> 00:56:14.454
You're right.

878
00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:18.725
They're so in love that they hold hands in the house too.

879
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.363
Gosh, if you had broken up their love forever,

880
00:56:23.497 --> 00:56:25.665
you'd have been punished.

881
00:56:26.032 --> 00:56:29.202
You know, there's a new movie about people in the underworld.

882
00:56:29.269 --> 00:56:32.873
These people lose all their wealth and scream all day long.

883
00:56:32.873 --> 00:56:34.207
- Hey! - Oh my.

884
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:37.244
Mrs. Yang, thank you for offering to help me.

885
00:56:41.348 --> 00:56:43.617
Gosh, is she just plain stupid?

886
00:56:43.617 --> 00:56:47.554
Or is she trying to make fun of me?

887
00:56:48.522 --> 00:56:50.023
I really don't get her.

888
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:55.996
I beg you.

889
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.432
Raise her as your own child.

890
00:56:58.565 --> 00:57:01.435
Raise her with love as if she were your child.

891
00:57:02.002 --> 00:57:04.504
Make her forget that she ever had...

892
00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:07.207
a mother like me.

893
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:10.677
Make her happy.

894
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:20.353
Why are you sighing?

895
00:57:22.389 --> 00:57:25.725
I keep thinking about what Mom said...

896
00:57:25.725 --> 00:57:27.227
when she asked you to find my brother.

897
00:57:28.328 --> 00:57:30.497
That people who are destined to meet will meet?

898
00:57:31.665 --> 00:57:32.766
What about it?

899
00:57:33.033 --> 00:57:36.036
I'm scared that Han Gyul's real mom might come here.

900
00:57:36.303 --> 00:57:38.305
Will she be released soon?

901
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:41.808
She gave up her fostering rights.

902
00:57:42.742 --> 00:57:44.211
Even if she does come here, nothing will happen.

903
00:57:45.178 --> 00:57:46.413
I hope so.

904
00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.883
Han Gyul has just settled down.

905
00:57:50.183 --> 00:57:53.520
It'd be inhumane to show up and distract her.

906
00:57:53.887 --> 00:57:55.055
Don't worry.

907
00:57:56.323 --> 00:57:59.326
If that happens, I'll teach her a lesson.

908
00:57:59.493 --> 00:58:01.161
How are you going to do that?

909
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:06.032
Like this.

910
00:58:06.032 --> 00:58:07.234
That tickles.

911
00:58:11.104 --> 00:58:13.373
Come on. One second.

912
00:58:13.373 --> 00:58:15.408
Excuse me.

913
00:58:16.543 --> 00:58:19.746
I'm sorry. I didn't knock.

914
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:22.015
I'm so sorry.

915
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:24.184
Have some desserts.

916
00:58:25.118 --> 00:58:27.754
I'll sleep with Han Gyul tonight in my room,

917
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:31.024
so keep doing what you were doing.

918
00:58:31.057 --> 00:58:32.325
No, Mother.

919
00:58:32.325 --> 00:58:34.094
- What? - Have a seat.

920
00:58:34.094 --> 00:58:37.197
For what? Why would I sit here?

921
00:58:37.197 --> 00:58:39.165
I'll sleep with Han Gyul.

922
00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:41.368
Keep going.

923
00:58:49.676 --> 00:58:50.944
Long time no see.

924
00:58:54.347 --> 00:58:56.750
You're wearing something so expensive.

925
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.985
You know you should thank me for it, right?

926
00:59:00.387 --> 00:59:02.155
I hate Aunt Su Ji.

927
00:59:12.332 --> 00:59:13.867
Did you finish closing?

928
00:59:13.934 --> 00:59:15.201
Yes, boss.

929
00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:23.076
Boss.

930
00:59:23.243 --> 00:59:25.345
You know the kid's mom who played with Se Ra today?

931
00:59:25.345 --> 00:59:26.613
Han Gyul's mom.

932
00:59:26.846 --> 00:59:28.014
What about her?

933
00:59:28.014 --> 00:59:29.783
What's she like?

934
00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:33.153
Why do you want to know?

935
00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:35.755
Do you know her?

936
00:59:35.755 --> 00:59:37.958
No. I'm just curious.

937
00:59:38.558 --> 00:59:41.795
Right. You wouldn't have had a chance to know someone like her.

938
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:45.098
She looks rich.

939
00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:47.367
But she's suspicious in some ways.

940
00:59:48.268 --> 00:59:50.036
She has no history.

941
00:59:50.904 --> 00:59:52.539
If you hear anything on whether...

942
00:59:52.539 --> 00:59:54.908
I should keep hang out with her, let me know.

943
00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:56.843
Don't worry, boss.

944
01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:07.454
For a family to do well, they should get a good daughter-in-law.

945
01:00:07.621 --> 01:00:09.889
I'm benefiting from you, Ru Ri.

946
01:00:10.657 --> 01:00:13.727
Yes. You should be nice to her.

947
01:00:14.094 --> 01:00:16.262
I'm back to you thanks to Ru Ri.

948
01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:18.498
Don't worry.

949
01:00:18.598 --> 01:00:21.368
I'm going to meet her parents on Friday.

950
01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.769
Let's rush the wedding.

951
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:29.442
So I'd like to ask you a favor.

952
01:00:30.243 --> 01:00:33.747
Can you tell us about yourself?

953
01:00:35.115 --> 01:00:37.117
We'll have a child when we get married.

954
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:40.654
I thought I should know about you.

955
01:00:41.655 --> 01:00:44.791
Sure. I was planning to tell you one day.

956
01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:47.494
Did you know...

957
01:00:48.094 --> 01:00:50.930
I was adopted to the US?

958
01:00:51.498 --> 01:00:52.565
Yes.

959
01:01:05.712 --> 01:01:08.515
Have you looked for your real parents?

960
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.520
I missed them for a while, but I gave up now.

961
01:01:15.055 --> 01:01:18.625
I think I was born to be lonely.

962
01:01:18.825 --> 01:01:20.660
I decided to accept it as my fate.

963
01:01:24.564 --> 01:01:28.101
Then who's your closest friend?

964
01:01:28.735 --> 01:01:29.936
I'm not sure.

965
01:01:31.538 --> 01:01:33.406
People who made me stand where I am today...

966
01:01:33.973 --> 01:01:37.177
would be Ae Ri's Mom and Director Park.

967
01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:42.515
How did you meet Director Park?

968
01:01:42.982 --> 01:01:46.786
He worked as a manager when I first opened my own restaurant.

969
01:01:47.554 --> 01:01:50.223
We worked together for almost 20 years.

970
01:01:50.223 --> 01:01:52.959
He's the only person I can trust.

971
01:01:54.094 --> 01:01:56.863
Did you ever have any trouble...

972
01:01:56.863 --> 01:01:59.099
with him?

973
01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.768
Can't you tell after all you went through?

974
01:02:02.335 --> 01:02:04.804
Director Park's obsessed with work.

975
01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:08.308
He even told me to dump Ae Ri for the company...

976
01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:11.077
when she caused so much trouble.

977
01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.282
When and how did Ae Ri's mom die?

978
01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:19.853
It's all my fault.

979
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.823
After liquidating the company in LA three years ago,

980
01:02:24.057 --> 01:02:25.992
I planned to return to Korea.

981
01:02:26.226 --> 01:02:29.696
Of course, it was to find you and your mom.

982
01:02:31.464 --> 01:02:36.336
Ae Ri's mom and Director Park were against it.

983
01:02:37.937 --> 01:02:39.606
I was stubborn.

984
01:02:40.907 --> 01:02:42.575
We had big trouble.

985
01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:46.679
From what I heard,

986
01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.450
Ae Ri's mom liked you for a long time.

987
01:02:59.325 --> 01:03:03.096
Even though I knew it, I couldn't accept it.

988
01:03:04.063 --> 01:03:06.533
In the end, she committed suicide...

989
01:03:07.767 --> 01:03:09.636
because of it.

990
01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:16.176
Like I said before,

991
01:03:17.177 --> 01:03:20.747
she's my savior as well as a debt in my heart.

992
01:03:21.848 --> 01:03:24.517
That's why I can't turn my back on Ae Ri.

993
01:03:42.035 --> 01:03:44.304
Chairman Kevin had such a sad life.

994
01:03:44.504 --> 01:03:47.207
He was abandoned by his parents as a child.

995
01:03:47.207 --> 01:03:49.175
Then he was adopted abroad...

996
01:03:49.175 --> 01:03:50.810
and fell in love with someone.

997
01:03:51.544 --> 01:03:53.112
But they broke up.

998
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.282
He barely became successful,

999
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:58.117
but there are enemies everywhere.

1000
01:03:58.117 --> 01:04:00.453
So I should stay next to him and protect him.

1001
01:04:01.554 --> 01:04:05.058
I'm going to find out who's behind Joo Ae Ri.

1002
01:04:07.493 --> 01:04:09.863
We didn't earn much today.

1003
01:04:09.863 --> 01:04:14.434
We only found out that Chairman Kevin trusts Director Park so much.

1004
01:04:14.868 --> 01:04:16.536
He's not reliable either.

1005
01:04:17.036 --> 01:04:19.606
The enemy's always near you.

1006
01:04:19.973 --> 01:04:22.642
But he told Chairman Kevin to desert Ae Ri.

1007
01:04:22.642 --> 01:04:24.711
He might be true to him.

1008
01:04:24.911 --> 01:04:28.615
I'm not going to trust anyone until I check the CCTV footage.

1009
01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:32.118
One second.

1010
01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:35.455
It's the nurse.

1011
01:04:36.556 --> 01:04:37.924
Yes, Nurse.

1012
01:04:39.726 --> 01:04:42.762
What? You've found the witness?

1013
01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:58.311
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1014
01:04:58.478 --> 01:04:59.545
We have a witness.

1015
01:04:59.545 --> 01:05:01.714
She saw him coming out from the room...

1016
01:05:01.714 --> 01:05:02.982
as soon as the alarm on the respirator went off.

1017
01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.984
They recently had the order from above...

1018
01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.453
and deleted all data related to Mr. Kim.

1019
01:05:07.453 --> 01:05:09.188
Are you having an affair, Mr. Lee?

1020
01:05:09.188 --> 01:05:10.823
I can forgive everything...

1021
01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:13.159
but not the affair.

1022
01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.461
Kids are coming for a party. It's going to be exhausting.

1023
01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:18.064
I'm looking forward to it. It's her first birthday party.

1024
01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:20.533
If you tell your mom you saw me,

1025
01:05:20.533 --> 01:05:22.135
I'm going to take you. Get it?

1026
01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:23.803
Jung Tae Yang's prying me.

1027
01:05:23.803 --> 01:05:25.038
Are you going to let him?

1028
01:05:25.038 --> 01:05:27.907
You're just going to use me and abandon me, aren't you?
