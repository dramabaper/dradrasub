3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.850
(Episode 39)

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.210
Well, how are the results?

5
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.348
It's an imaginary cancer.

6
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.958
"Imaginary cancer"?

7
00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.399
Do you mean it's like imagining cancer?

8
00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.129
Yes. Have you heard about imaginary pregnancy?

9
00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:33.969
Yes. When you want to have a child so desperately,

10
00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.238
even your stomach gets bigger.

11
00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:37.709
Yes. That's the case for him.

12
00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.008
I think it started from mental stress.

13
00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.378
But still, he even vomited blood.

14
00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:46.779
If you have imaginary cancer,

15
00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.719
do you get those symptoms too?

16
00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.919
If he's suffering so much,

17
00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.289
he wouldn't eat on time...

18
00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.188
or sleep on time.

19
00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.899
There's stress stomachache too.

20
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.128
He shows inflammation and malnutrition.

21
00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:06.229
He may have symptoms that look like stomach cancer.

22
00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.339
I don't think...

23
00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:11.109
it's only about his imagination.

24
00:01:11.908 --> 00:01:13.068
Then...

25
00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:18.279
he created that cancer because he wanted to die?

26
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.178
I think that's the case for your father.

27
00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:24.988
Then...

28
00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:28.389
he's going to survive, right?

29
00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:33.699
Ji An.

30
00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.729
Leave her.

31
00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:42.969
Sir, then if I tell my father...

32
00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:45.208
that he doesn't have cancer,

33
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:47.408
will the symptoms go away?

34
00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.678
It's not that simple.

35
00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.609
He probably has serious depression.

36
00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.818
"Depression"?

37
00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:58.288
For now, I'll transfer you to the neuropsychiatry.

38
00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:01.119
There aren't that many fathers in Korea...

39
00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.988
who talk about their worries to others.

40
00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.958
Families don't have to live together.

41
00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.298
We just need to live the best of our lives.

42
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.278
Whatever the stage I am, I'm not getting treatment.

43
00:02:57.808 --> 00:02:59.678
I couldn't choose how to live,

44
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.819
but I'll choose how I'll die.

45
00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:36.079
Are you still crying?

46
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:40.458
He doesn't have cancer. Why would you cry?

47
00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.458
Are you crying because you're happy?

48
00:03:44.988 --> 00:03:46.329
Does your heart ache?

49
00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.729
Because I know.

50
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.968
Because I know why he did that.

51
00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.169
My heart aches so much.

52
00:03:58.708 --> 00:03:59.939
It's shocking.

53
00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:05.278
He must've been in so much pain...

54
00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.048
to have created cancer.

55
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:13.558
By the way, where's Dad?

56
00:04:14.218 --> 00:04:15.218
I'll just try calling him.

57
00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:21.829
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

58
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.299
His phone's still turned off.

59
00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:26.538
What do we do now?

60
00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:28.898
I mean, where do we find Dad?

61
00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:33.208
Let's go home for now.

62
00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.278
- My goodness. - We're here.

63
00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:44.088
Hi. Manager Sunwoo.

64
00:04:44.288 --> 00:04:47.788
Move this to the wrapping section.

65
00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.588
And you can clean this garbage.

66
00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:52.088
- Why move the wrapping? - Well...

67
00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:53.129
Mr. Kim, who does the wrapping,

68
00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.999
suddenly called and said that he quit today.

69
00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.598
The absence of Seo Ji An...

70
00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:59.898
is very noticeable.

71
00:05:00.168 --> 00:05:03.708
Since the quick hand isn't around,

72
00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:06.408
we can barely manage to do the cutting.

73
00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.379
- You should do the work. - What?

74
00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.208
I have an important meeting.

75
00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:14.749
You want me to do the work? Alone?

76
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.449
I posted a hiring ad on the internet.

77
00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.358
I'm going on my first date today.

78
00:05:21.718 --> 00:05:22.718
Gosh.

79
00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:24.429
Please.

80
00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:27.028
I called.

81
00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:29.999
Dad quit the distribution center two years ago.

82
00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:31.569
Two years?

83
00:05:31.968 --> 00:05:34.098
Did he work on a daily basis for two years then?

84
00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.299
How did he...

85
00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:39.338
bring the same pay for two years?

86
00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.038
They fired everyone over the age of 60.

87
00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.309
No one's in touch with him since then. What now?

88
00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:46.819
I can't find where he is.

89
00:05:49.018 --> 00:05:51.348
His phone's off. What should we do?

90
00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.788
What if we can't find him?

91
00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.918
We'll find him.

92
00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.389
Don't worry about it, Mom.

93
00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.458
How do we find him?

94
00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.259
We know nothing about Dad.

95
00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.329
Dad will turn his phone on at least once.

96
00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:07.968
He'll know that we're worried.

97
00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:12.639
What if he threw out his phone?

98
00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.929
Gosh, Honey. My goodness.

99
00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:32.329
No. He'd never do that.

100
00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:35.299
How are you so sure?

101
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.699
Dad already ran away from his family...

102
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.239
and decided to die alone.

103
00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.139
Because he's Dad.

104
00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.579
He didn't leave us.

105
00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.809
He left because he thinks we don't need him.

106
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:54.619
He knows we'll call him when we get the result.

107
00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:55.879
He'll check at least once.

108
00:06:56.588 --> 00:06:59.749
And he might be curious about the result too.

109
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.759
You don't seem to be worried indeed.

110
00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:07.228
Because we'll find him.

111
00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:11.799
There's nothing to worry about. He's not ill.

112
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:14.239
We've bought time.

113
00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:30.218
Things I want to do.

114
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.989
Play three songs perfectly.

115
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.788
Have a recital in front of my parents' graves.

116
00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:38.329
Watch a movie in a theater.

117
00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.028
Go to schools.

118
00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:41.658
Things I want to eat.

119
00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.329
Gondre rice, buckwheat bukumi,

120
00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:45.929
tadpole noodles,

121
00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:47.699
Mom and Dad's Chinese restaurant,

122
00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:49.739
and Jugyo-dong bulgogi.

123
00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:02.319
Isn't it too late for design school now?

124
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.218
I'm glad I can go at least now.

125
00:08:04.218 --> 00:08:05.449
It's really fun.

126
00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:07.889
It's not your major.

127
00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.559
You won't get a job by studying at an academy.

128
00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:13.228
That's not why I'm attending the classes.

129
00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:15.299
I don't even want to get an office job now.

130
00:08:15.898 --> 00:08:18.299
Designing and making things...

131
00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:19.999
is more fun than I thought.

132
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:23.069
Hey, Ji An. You're too old to do something for fun.

133
00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.139
Ji Tae.

134
00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.848
When I didn't come back home and disappeared,

135
00:08:34.449 --> 00:08:36.079
I went to a mountain to end my life.

136
00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:39.789
What?

137
00:08:45.988 --> 00:08:47.029
Ji An.

138
00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:48.429
You know, when you're about to die,

139
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.968
people say that your life flashes before your eyes.

140
00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:54.399
That actually happened to me.

141
00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.939
But I only saw regrets.

142
00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.779
"Why did I live like that?"

143
00:09:01.478 --> 00:09:03.679
"Why did I try so hard to get an office job?"

144
00:09:04.508 --> 00:09:06.919
"Why did I put myself in pain for years..."

145
00:09:07.218 --> 00:09:08.978
"in my youth?"

146
00:09:11.088 --> 00:09:12.919
Since things didn't go my way,

147
00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:15.958
I was always angry and shut myself off.

148
00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.329
Even from Mom and Dad.

149
00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:20.728
I felt sorry to everyone around me.

150
00:09:21.758 --> 00:09:23.329
If I was sorry to everyone and had only regrets...

151
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.228
at the moment I thought I was dying,

152
00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:28.439
that means I'd been living a wrong life.

153
00:09:31.508 --> 00:09:32.738
I didn't know that.

154
00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:35.878
I had no idea.

155
00:09:37.008 --> 00:09:40.079
I knew that Dad went looking for you,

156
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.789
but you were always brave and took things well.

157
00:09:47.358 --> 00:09:49.118
I'm sorry, Ji An.

158
00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.588
I didn't tell you to make you feel sad.

159
00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.299
I'm telling you because it's all in the past.

160
00:09:58.669 --> 00:10:00.498
When I saw you again,

161
00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:02.439
I was really happy to see you.

162
00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:09.179
So I realized...

163
00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:13.449
that I must work on something I want...

164
00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:14.649
to have no regrets.

165
00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.218
Everything depends on how you perceive things.

166
00:10:17.748 --> 00:10:19.348
Dad's problem is an example of it too.

167
00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:23.228
Have you ever thought of our parents dying?

168
00:10:25.429 --> 00:10:26.958
I got so scared.

169
00:10:28.598 --> 00:10:29.628
Ji Tae.

170
00:10:29.868 --> 00:10:32.799
I learned many people have different views in life.

171
00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.039
There are other ways too.

172
00:10:50.888 --> 00:10:53.118
Should we have gotten hot food? It's cold today.

173
00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:54.488
You're not eating much.

174
00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:57.429
No... No. This is delicious.

175
00:10:57.628 --> 00:11:00.559
I just can't eat at ease because I'm nervous.

176
00:11:01.358 --> 00:11:03.628
Actually, I feel the same.

177
00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:05.769
It's our 1st meal on our 1st date.

178
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:08.069
I see. Then we don't have to finish.

179
00:11:08.098 --> 00:11:10.738
There's food involved in what I wanted to do.

180
00:11:11.368 --> 00:11:13.309
What is it? Why is food involved?

181
00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:15.738
Do you want to go to that theater again?

182
00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:19.309
No. Well, I want to walk around crowded areas.

183
00:11:19.508 --> 00:11:22.419
Like Hongdae, Garosugil, and Gyeongridangil.

184
00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:24.088
I wanted to walk around places like those...

185
00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:26.189
while we eat street food.

186
00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:29.088
My gosh.

187
00:11:31.588 --> 00:11:32.659
What is it?

188
00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:36.669
You're cute.

189
00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:38.899
Seriously?

190
00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.238
Stop it.

191
00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:43.138
I'm sorry for being rude before.

192
00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:45.508
I misunderstood some things about you.

193
00:11:45.968 --> 00:11:47.579
What? What kind of misunderstandings?

194
00:11:49.378 --> 00:11:51.549
You know my sister, right?

195
00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:54.579
She became happy since she's with Nam Goo,

196
00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:56.478
but she was very timid before they got together.

197
00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.718
I know.

198
00:11:59.348 --> 00:12:02.059
She'd been timid since she was scarred in her past.

199
00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:06.289
I hated seeing my sister living a lethargic life.

200
00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:07.998
I couldn't understand my sister.

201
00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:11.468
So I got the wrong idea about you when you did...

202
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:13.098
a bad job at the dentist.

203
00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:15.069
So when you couldn't speak up for yourself...

204
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:17.909
and followed me around, I found you frustrating.

205
00:12:18.608 --> 00:12:20.039
I see.

206
00:12:20.608 --> 00:12:23.348
You liked confident women who have...

207
00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:25.309
positive influences on you.

208
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:28.878
In a nutshell, you liked smart women, right?

209
00:12:29.319 --> 00:12:30.319
Who?

210
00:12:30.888 --> 00:12:32.118
Do you mean my first love?

211
00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:33.519
What?

212
00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:36.588
I was in high school and still lost back then.

213
00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:39.429
Influence I had was important back then.

214
00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:41.758
I'm an adult now.

215
00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:45.829
But if so,

216
00:12:46.669 --> 00:12:48.669
why do you like me?

217
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:50.409
What do you like about me?

218
00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:52.539
There's no reason for liking someone.

219
00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:56.008
But still. You didn't like me before.

220
00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:01.618
I was sorry for hating you after I got to know you.

221
00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:06.888
And I saw the notebook of your written recipes.

222
00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:08.789
I took a peek when you left it at the cafe.

223
00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:12.458
What? You read my notebook?

224
00:13:13.358 --> 00:13:16.799
I learned that you had a goal.

225
00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:19.628
And when you stopped Hee from leaving,

226
00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:22.039
you fell while running,

227
00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:23.708
but you didn't even know you were hurt.

228
00:13:24.309 --> 00:13:27.039
That day, I was touched.

229
00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:29.138
I choked up a bit too.

230
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:33.649
I learned that you had a big heart. Then...

231
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:38.419
Then?

232
00:13:41.718 --> 00:13:43.728
Then I suddenly started to have feelings for you.

233
00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:45.988
Do you need anything more?

234
00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:48.258
I just like who you are.

235
00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:54.338
Who I am? Just like that?

236
00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:56.508
I just like you because you're you.

237
00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:07.348
What is it?

238
00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:11.949
It's been a while...

239
00:14:13.388 --> 00:14:15.858
since someone told me they like me for myself.

240
00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:19.789
It's so nice to hear that again.

241
00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:30.608
I'll buy you pork belly since it's our last day.

242
00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:32.208
"Pork belly"?

243
00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:35.378
You don't eat fatty meat. It's not healthy.

244
00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:38.149
Then do you expect me to buy beef with this pay?

245
00:14:39.978 --> 00:14:41.019
But I like beef.

246
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.218
Please eat a lot.

247
00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:50.559
You too.

248
00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:52.529
Okay.

249
00:14:53.598 --> 00:14:55.899
By the way, you have my respect.

250
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.728
I thought you would quit after your first day.

251
00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:00.899
The pay is generous.

252
00:15:02.598 --> 00:15:04.368
You should go back home now.

253
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:08.608
You and Ji An can be together later.

254
00:15:08.878 --> 00:15:10.309
You must go on with your life first.

255
00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:13.218
How can you continue to live paycheck to paycheck?

256
00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:15.279
This has nothing to do with her now.

257
00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:17.189
Pardon?

258
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:18.988
It became a fight between me and my grandfather.

259
00:15:20.088 --> 00:15:22.718
He doesn't want to give me a fair chance at this.

260
00:15:23.258 --> 00:15:24.659
But if I go back like this,

261
00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:26.529
I can't live with myself.

262
00:15:26.699 --> 00:15:28.728
How will you go up against him?

263
00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:32.228
I must be independent without any ties to him.

264
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.998
Even if it means I must start from the bottom.

265
00:15:37.238 --> 00:15:39.669
You're back to square one.

266
00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.508
Your efforts for weeks have been wasted.

267
00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.309
I know, right?

268
00:15:43.878 --> 00:15:45.608
But I don't mind the hard work.

269
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.919
I'm beginning to think that I'm finally living...

270
00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.388
my own, true life now.

271
00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:56.829
- Dig in. - Okay. Enjoy.

272
00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:29.789
What is it?

273
00:16:30.988 --> 00:16:32.228
No... Nothing.

274
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:34.399
Hey. Let's have some of that.

275
00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:36.799
Let's go get it.

276
00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.348
What is it?

277
00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:52.409
What?

278
00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.118
- Left or right? Right? - To the right.

279
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:07.029
I'm going to do it now.

280
00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:08.598
- It's going down. - Okay.

281
00:17:15.698 --> 00:17:17.309
I got it! I won it!

282
00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:24.509
Here.

283
00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:26.108
Thank you.

284
00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:27.118
That was easy.

285
00:17:29.118 --> 00:17:30.549
I like it.

286
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:33.819
Where do you live?

287
00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:36.358
I want to drop you off today.

288
00:17:36.358 --> 00:17:39.858
No. You didn't bring your car today.

289
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:41.358
I can take a taxi.

290
00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:44.469
Do you have a secret about your family?

291
00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.868
Like it turns out that you live in a palace?

292
00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:49.638
Is it like where Elsa, from Frozen, lives?

293
00:17:50.408 --> 00:17:52.138
No... No. That's not it.

294
00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:54.539
It's just that my parents are quite strict.

295
00:17:54.638 --> 00:17:56.239
It's kind of late today anyway.

296
00:17:57.348 --> 00:17:58.908
I should bring my car next time.

297
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:02.878
There comes the taxi.

298
00:18:13.928 --> 00:18:15.858
Make sure you call me when you get home today.

299
00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:18.969
I will. I had a lot of fun today.

300
00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:20.838
Bye.

301
00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:27.408
31 3985.

302
00:18:27.438 --> 00:18:29.479
31 3985.

303
00:18:29.479 --> 00:18:31.709
(Ji Soo's taxi number 31 3985)

304
00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:35.878
I wonder if her parents are really strict.

305
00:18:45.489 --> 00:18:48.398
It looks like you had a tough day.

306
00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:49.999
I worked at an ice factory.

307
00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:52.168
Fortunately, today was my last day.

308
00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:55.039
How about your new business item?

309
00:18:55.338 --> 00:18:56.438
Nothing yet.

310
00:18:56.838 --> 00:18:59.509
Perhaps you're still looking for...

311
00:18:59.509 --> 00:19:01.309
a business opportunity like a rich man?

312
00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:02.838
What do you mean?

313
00:19:03.249 --> 00:19:05.249
It's hard to stop being who you've been...

314
00:19:05.249 --> 00:19:07.249
for the past 33 years.

315
00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:09.178
You should lower your standards.

316
00:19:09.479 --> 00:19:11.088
Thank you for your advice.

317
00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:13.858
By the way, did you wait to give me an advice?

318
00:19:13.858 --> 00:19:16.319
No. If you're going to keep doing part-time jobs,

319
00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:17.928
you should work at the woodworking studio.

320
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:19.928
What can I do there?

321
00:19:20.229 --> 00:19:22.898
The staff in charge of packaging had quit.

322
00:19:22.898 --> 00:19:25.799
And Ji An's busy with a family situation.

323
00:19:25.969 --> 00:19:27.269
So we're behind the schedule.

324
00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.638
Why is Ji An busy?

325
00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:31.809
Is something wrong with her family?

326
00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:33.539
I don't know the details,

327
00:19:33.838 --> 00:19:35.878
but I think her father is not well.

328
00:19:36.338 --> 00:19:37.809
Her father?

329
00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.088
Are you all right, sir?

330
00:19:49.158 --> 00:19:50.789
How is he not well?

331
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.259
I am not sure.

332
00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.128
She went to the hospital to hear the diagnosis.

333
00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:02.898
Let's...

334
00:20:04.009 --> 00:20:05.069
stop it then.

335
00:20:06.608 --> 00:20:07.678
Ji An.

336
00:20:08.838 --> 00:20:10.348
Why do you care?

337
00:20:10.348 --> 00:20:12.209
Why do you care if I die of high fever or not?

338
00:20:12.209 --> 00:20:13.348
You shouldn't have cared.

339
00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:14.678
I am nobody to you.

340
00:20:21.459 --> 00:20:22.559
Hyuk.

341
00:20:22.918 --> 00:20:23.959
Ji An.

342
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:26.229
How's your father? What happened?

343
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:28.029
My father is okay.

344
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:30.628
Is he okay? You said he collapsed.

345
00:20:30.628 --> 00:20:33.868
Yes. Anyway, he's fine.

346
00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:35.499
So that's why you're happy.

347
00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:37.269
Yes, very happy.

348
00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:41.378
By the way, where are you coming from?

349
00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:44.979
Now that you're feeling better, I can tell you.

350
00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:46.719
What is it?

351
00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:51.519
I am going out...

352
00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.418
with my bakery friend.

353
00:20:54.388 --> 00:20:55.418
Really?

354
00:20:55.888 --> 00:20:57.459
I'm coming back from a date.

355
00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:00.529
Then maybe...

356
00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:05.729
Let's talk inside.

357
00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.408
Ji An, I'll go inside first.

358
00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.719
What is it?

359
00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:27.289
How is your father?

360
00:21:29.358 --> 00:21:30.588
How is he?

361
00:21:30.928 --> 00:21:32.529
How did you find out?

362
00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:36.059
He's fine.

363
00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:37.698
I heard he collapsed.

364
00:21:37.969 --> 00:21:39.299
How can he be fine?

365
00:21:39.729 --> 00:21:41.668
He did collapse,

366
00:21:41.668 --> 00:21:43.668
but he will be fine.

367
00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:46.368
Did you come to ask me that?

368
00:21:46.368 --> 00:21:49.539
Do I really not mean anything to you?

369
00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:52.779
You like me. So how can you do this?

370
00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:55.148
Are your words different from your mind?

371
00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:56.279
How can you do that?

372
00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:58.348
How can your mind and body act differently?

373
00:22:00.489 --> 00:22:02.759
Why did you take care of me?

374
00:22:03.229 --> 00:22:04.628
Did you pity me?

375
00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:06.229
Is that why you took care of me...

376
00:22:06.229 --> 00:22:07.898
without saying a word about your sick father?

377
00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:10.829
How can I be the only one who doesn't know about it?

378
00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.928
Is it so hard to tell me that you are struggling?

379
00:22:12.928 --> 00:22:15.438
I never told other people that I was struggling.

380
00:22:15.438 --> 00:22:16.969
But other people know about it.

381
00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:19.039
At least they know what's happening to you.

382
00:22:19.209 --> 00:22:20.408
Do Kyung.

383
00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:21.809
Why does Hyuk know about your situation?

384
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:23.608
I guess it's because he's your friend.

385
00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.079
Then why does Yong Gook know?

386
00:22:25.908 --> 00:22:27.249
He's my boss.

387
00:22:28.648 --> 00:22:30.448
I am his staff.

388
00:22:30.688 --> 00:22:31.989
I have to report to him...

389
00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:33.658
about why I have to leave during working hours.

390
00:22:33.658 --> 00:22:35.989
I can't leave work without telling him.

391
00:22:38.989 --> 00:22:40.858
Is there nothing...

392
00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:42.858
that connects us?

393
00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:44.668
There's nothing.

394
00:22:45.729 --> 00:22:47.938
Aren't we over?

395
00:22:49.638 --> 00:22:53.069
You said this was over.

396
00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:54.838
It was because you were being a coward.

397
00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:56.878
What?

398
00:22:56.878 --> 00:22:59.408
Ji An, you are acting very cowardly.

399
00:22:59.408 --> 00:23:01.049
Your words and actions are completely different.

400
00:23:01.348 --> 00:23:03.188
So I told you.

401
00:23:03.418 --> 00:23:05.719
I can't control my feelings for you.

402
00:23:06.249 --> 00:23:08.858
But I have no intention of doing anything more.

403
00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:13.158
- Do you think this is... - All right. Okay.

404
00:23:14.098 --> 00:23:15.098
That's enough.

405
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:17.668
Let's stop there.

406
00:23:26.108 --> 00:23:27.138
It's...

407
00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:30.979
hard for me to do this too.

408
00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:56.809
Do I really not mean anything to you?

409
00:23:59.569 --> 00:24:00.908
I am going out...

410
00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:02.678
with my bakery friend.

411
00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:24.868
Goodnight.

412
00:24:25.469 --> 00:24:27.969
You too, Mr. Sunwoo.

413
00:24:31.408 --> 00:24:33.739
How can you call your boyfriend like that?

414
00:24:37.249 --> 00:24:38.948
Then how should I call you?

415
00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:43.789
Anything other than "Mr. Sunwoo" is good.

416
00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:49.459
Goodnight,

417
00:24:50.158 --> 00:24:51.529
Hyuk.

418
00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.799
Goodnight, Ji Soo.

419
00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:05.908
(Ji An)

420
00:25:11.908 --> 00:25:13.079
Hello?

421
00:25:13.749 --> 00:25:16.279
Do you have time during your lunchtime tomorrow?

422
00:25:52.489 --> 00:25:55.319
033 is the area code of Gangwon Province.

423
00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:57.729
But nobody is in his hometown.

424
00:25:57.729 --> 00:25:59.358
Where could he have called?

425
00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:02.729
Tomorrow, I will call the village head...

426
00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.029
of Father's hometown and ask.

427
00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:05.569
Will you do that?

428
00:26:05.569 --> 00:26:07.638
Yes. You should sleep now.

429
00:26:08.938 --> 00:26:10.168
By the way,

430
00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:13.438
is something wrong between you two?

431
00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.039
What?

432
00:26:15.638 --> 00:26:18.579
Is Soo A away because of me?

433
00:26:18.908 --> 00:26:21.418
Because the atmosphere here is awkward?

434
00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.878
It's not that.

435
00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:24.348
Her company publishes reference books,

436
00:26:24.348 --> 00:26:25.448
so when they're publishing a new book,

437
00:26:25.448 --> 00:26:26.819
they sometimes work away for over a month.

438
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:30.628
Is that right? I'm relieved then.

439
00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:34.459
Don't even tell her about Father.

440
00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:35.698
It will only burden her.

441
00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.249
Mr. Kang, I will go out for a while.

442
00:26:56.249 --> 00:26:57.688
Okay. Wait.

443
00:26:58.588 --> 00:27:01.618
Starting tomorrow, come to work by 7am.

444
00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:03.888
- 7am? - Yes.

445
00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:05.888
I am a breadwinner now.

446
00:27:05.888 --> 00:27:08.198
So I should make more bread and money.

447
00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:10.969
Now that you've mastered the basic dough,

448
00:27:10.969 --> 00:27:12.999
I'll teach you to make bread. Can you make it?

449
00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:15.039
Of course I can. Of course I can.

450
00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:23.608
- You're here. - Why would you run?

451
00:27:23.608 --> 00:27:24.948
You could've fallen.

452
00:27:24.948 --> 00:27:26.848
I was worried that you might be hungry.

453
00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:29.148
My goodness. What's for today's lunch?

454
00:27:29.989 --> 00:27:32.719
It's avocado pollack roe bibimbap and miso soup.

455
00:27:33.019 --> 00:27:34.388
We saw it on TV yesterday,

456
00:27:34.388 --> 00:27:36.188
and Nam Goo craved for it.

457
00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:39.688
Gosh, I can't say anything.

458
00:27:40.398 --> 00:27:41.898
I used to eat cup noodles all the time,

459
00:27:41.898 --> 00:27:43.769
so my stomach is going crazy right now.

460
00:27:43.769 --> 00:27:46.739
It's like, "What's going on? This is unlike you."

461
00:27:46.739 --> 00:27:48.138
Come on.

462
00:27:48.138 --> 00:27:50.368
I'd like to learn how to cook from you too.

463
00:27:50.838 --> 00:27:53.039
Ji Soo, can you come back in 50 minutes?

464
00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.878
Of course. I have to come back...

465
00:27:54.878 --> 00:27:56.648
so you can go on your lunchtime stroll.

466
00:27:56.648 --> 00:27:57.979
I'll be back.

467
00:27:58.178 --> 00:28:00.178
I will cut this avocado.

468
00:28:00.249 --> 00:28:01.279
Will you do that?

469
00:28:01.618 --> 00:28:04.348
Of course. It's too hard for you. See?

470
00:28:04.648 --> 00:28:08.188
How could you cut it with your soft hands?

471
00:28:09.928 --> 00:28:12.489
- What was that? - My goodness.

472
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:21.838
Would this be too weak for a competition submission?

473
00:28:22.569 --> 00:28:23.569
It's so-so.

474
00:28:25.168 --> 00:28:27.908
I hope an idea just hits me.

475
00:28:30.848 --> 00:28:33.479
Are you preparing for a competition too?

476
00:28:34.418 --> 00:28:37.789
No, I am not. I've just enrolled in this class.

477
00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:40.559
But this is only an idea competition.

478
00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:42.459
It's okay if you're new to this class.

479
00:28:45.229 --> 00:28:47.928
Can I take a look at it then?

480
00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.499
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

481
00:28:55.499 --> 00:28:56.569
Is this the village hall?

482
00:28:57.309 --> 00:28:59.539
I am calling to ask you about something.

483
00:29:03.348 --> 00:29:05.009
I heard from Hyuk.

484
00:29:05.448 --> 00:29:06.948
I heard you're going out together.

485
00:29:08.219 --> 00:29:09.219
Yes.

486
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:12.918
It was obvious that he was into you.

487
00:29:16.118 --> 00:29:17.128
But...

488
00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:20.858
it seemed like you haven't told him about us,

489
00:29:20.858 --> 00:29:21.959
so I wanted to talk about it.

490
00:29:22.358 --> 00:29:24.198
Hyuk doesn't seem to know yet.

491
00:29:24.898 --> 00:29:27.368
Yes, I haven't told him yet.

492
00:29:28.168 --> 00:29:30.469
I don't know if I should tell him.

493
00:29:32.108 --> 00:29:34.338
You should tell him now if you're together.

494
00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:38.408
It's going to be tough to tell him.

495
00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.479
But Hyuk will know...

496
00:29:40.848 --> 00:29:43.648
if you used to be my twin sister.

497
00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:45.019
He knows everything.

498
00:29:45.648 --> 00:29:47.588
Well, he doesn't know...

499
00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:49.019
every detail between us.

500
00:29:49.019 --> 00:29:50.088
He only knows the main facts.

501
00:29:51.188 --> 00:29:54.499
But I think you should tell him...

502
00:29:54.729 --> 00:29:56.829
that you are the daughter of Haesung Corporation.

503
00:29:57.868 --> 00:30:00.239
Do I have to tell him that?

504
00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:02.499
We only went out once.

505
00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:04.938
When people start dating,

506
00:30:05.239 --> 00:30:07.178
they don't talk about what their parents do.

507
00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:10.608
Usually, people don't.

508
00:30:12.108 --> 00:30:13.448
But you're different.

509
00:30:15.579 --> 00:30:17.418
I will tell him a little later.

510
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:20.319
I need time to think too.

511
00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:24.428
Okay. You should do that then.

512
00:30:26.729 --> 00:30:28.858
When I decide to tell him,

513
00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:30.999
I will tell you.

514
00:30:34.168 --> 00:30:35.168
Okay.

515
00:30:37.069 --> 00:30:39.608
I have to go back to work, so I'll go now.

516
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:53.858
I'm back.

517
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:03.928
Let's eat lunch, Do Kyung.

518
00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:06.598
Hey, Ji An.

519
00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:16.178
The investors decided to withdraw?

520
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:19.249
It was Do Kyung's grandfather.

521
00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:24.348
He was so happy to get the investment.

522
00:31:25.088 --> 00:31:26.088
Are you upset?

523
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:29.888
To be honest, it's upsetting.

524
00:31:31.759 --> 00:31:33.628
I expected something to happen.

525
00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:35.029
But it's worse than what you imagined, right?

526
00:31:35.658 --> 00:31:38.098
But the fact even crazier than that...

527
00:31:38.628 --> 00:31:40.668
is that it made Do Kyung even more determined.

528
00:31:41.698 --> 00:31:44.069
He will never go back home like this.

529
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:47.279
He won't go back?

530
00:31:47.378 --> 00:31:48.779
He's very determined.

531
00:31:49.378 --> 00:31:51.579
You know that we're in need of a staff.

532
00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:55.148
So I made him work here for a few days.

533
00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:57.918
Please bear with it even if it's awkward.

534

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

535
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:14.868
What are you thinking?

536
00:32:16.908 --> 00:32:18.709
I know that you have pride,

537
00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:20.279
but you can't beat them.

538
00:32:21.178 --> 00:32:23.608
You know that. Why are you doing this?

539
00:32:26.479 --> 00:32:30.088
Just accept your fate, and go back to your place.

540
00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:32.418
He's your grandfather after all.

541
00:32:33.219 --> 00:32:34.219
Stop it.

542
00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:38.259
Do you think I am a thoughtless person?

543
00:32:39.128 --> 00:32:41.559
You know where you should be to be happy.

544
00:32:41.928 --> 00:32:43.628
That's why you don't need me.

545
00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:46.098
Then why are you...

546
00:32:46.569 --> 00:32:48.739
ignoring my feelings and telling me to go back?

547
00:32:49.098 --> 00:32:50.269
Who are you to say that?

548
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:52.138
It's a reckless decision. That's all.

549
00:32:52.739 --> 00:32:55.279
Your pride doesn't let you achieve everything.

550
00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:56.338
That's my call.

551
00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.309
Right.

552
00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:01.378
I will go back one day.

553
00:33:01.618 --> 00:33:02.948
I know that it's my path.

554
00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:05.188
I won't give up Haesung Corporation.

555
00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:07.559
However,

556
00:33:08.918 --> 00:33:11.229
I don't want to live as my grandfather's puppet.

557
00:33:13.628 --> 00:33:16.928
At first, I told you that it'd only take me a month.

558
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:18.569
I thought I could do it.

559
00:33:19.898 --> 00:33:20.938
Now,

560
00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:23.638
I am worried that a year might not be enough.

561
00:33:24.668 --> 00:33:26.108
I am afraid.

562
00:33:28.938 --> 00:33:30.148
So...

563
00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:32.309
don't treat me like someone...

564
00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:33.319
who always gets whatever he wants.

565
00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.479
Okay.

566
00:33:37.719 --> 00:33:39.388
I am sorry for being nosy.

567
00:33:48.358 --> 00:33:49.799
It's filled with customers.

568
00:33:52.168 --> 00:33:53.438
It's frustrating.

569
00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:55.668
How can you make money with such a small place?

570
00:33:58.569 --> 00:33:59.838
You should go.

571
00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:02.279
Our scales are too different.

572
00:34:02.638 --> 00:34:04.108
Anyway, when I take over the business,

573
00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:05.279
I won't have time to hang out with you.

574
00:34:05.448 --> 00:34:06.948
Hey, what do you mean?

575
00:34:06.948 --> 00:34:08.879
You should hire a staff and hang out with me.

576
00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:11.589
Why would I bother to hire a staff for you?

577
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:14.118
I can pay for the staff.

578
00:34:14.758 --> 00:34:17.028
Hang out with me just until I go abroad.

579
00:34:17.729 --> 00:34:19.428
If the owner is not there,

580
00:34:19.428 --> 00:34:21.428
that shop is bound to fail.

581
00:34:21.499 --> 00:34:22.829
I can't do that.

582
00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:24.899
You're so petty.

583
00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:28.468
Did you forget that I dragged you home?

584
00:34:30.408 --> 00:34:31.868
I will pay you back for that.

585
00:34:32.209 --> 00:34:33.209
After signing the contract tomorrow,

586
00:34:33.209 --> 00:34:34.638
I am going to work here for no pay.

587
00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:38.008
Just once? My gosh. Never mind.

588
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:42.149
Hey.

589
00:34:43.348 --> 00:34:46.218
You keep peeking at my shop.

590
00:34:46.348 --> 00:34:47.459
Are you going to buy something?

591
00:34:47.459 --> 00:34:49.459
Hello, sir.

592
00:34:49.459 --> 00:34:50.859
I will be the one to take over this place.

593
00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:53.089
I will be signing the contract tomorrow.

594
00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:55.298
What? What do you mean?

595
00:34:55.698 --> 00:34:58.068
I already sold this place.

596
00:34:58.098 --> 00:34:59.428
- What? - What?

597
00:35:02.169 --> 00:35:03.669
(Top Class Business Consulting)

598
00:35:05.068 --> 00:35:07.839
Give my money back!

599
00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.809
My money!

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:13.008
- Give it back to me! - My Money.

602
00:35:18.988 --> 00:35:21.218
My goodness. I think you got scammed.

603
00:35:22.818 --> 00:35:23.988
No way.

604
00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:28.098
I have a question for you.

605
00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:31.829
Shouldn't you go there too?

606
00:35:32.928 --> 00:35:35.999
My 5,000 dollars!

607
00:35:38.638 --> 00:35:42.738
Hey, look at this. In this contract...

608
00:35:45.479 --> 00:35:47.519
Is this contract even valid?

609
00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:49.888
Please calm down.

610
00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:03.298
Sir, there are no more orders, right? I'm done.

611
00:36:03.298 --> 00:36:04.928
Are your hands motored?

612
00:36:04.928 --> 00:36:06.738
There's no more. You may go home.

613
00:36:06.738 --> 00:36:07.738
Okay.

614
00:36:10.638 --> 00:36:12.468
- See you tomorrow. - Bye.

615
00:36:20.419 --> 00:36:21.749
(Father)

616
00:36:25.718 --> 00:36:26.818
Yes, Father.

617
00:36:39.499 --> 00:36:40.539
Father... Father.

618
00:36:45.008 --> 00:36:47.638
Are you even working with Ji An here?

619
00:36:48.209 --> 00:36:49.238
What?

620
00:36:56.178 --> 00:36:58.718
Father, how did you...

621
00:36:59.888 --> 00:37:02.189
Did mother check on me?

622
00:37:02.818 --> 00:37:04.528
She hasn't yet.

623
00:37:05.528 --> 00:37:06.528
What?

624
00:37:12.428 --> 00:37:15.868
The day you left, I took this from your car.

625
00:37:18.968 --> 00:37:20.379
Black box.

626
00:37:21.508 --> 00:37:23.109
- Then... - There were...

627
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:24.109
many interesting clips.

628
00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:25.809
There was So Ra too.

629
00:37:28.278 --> 00:37:29.419
I'm returning this to you...

630
00:37:29.419 --> 00:37:30.689
after seeing this only for myself.

631
00:37:31.348 --> 00:37:32.519
Then...

632
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:35.559
were you the only one who knew about this?

633
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.888
That's why I am telling you this.

634
00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:40.758
Do Kyung,

635
00:37:41.798 --> 00:37:43.568
give up on Ji An, and come back home.

636
00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.428
Father,

637
00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:47.698
you can never make her happy.

638
00:37:48.638 --> 00:37:50.138
What do you mean?

639
00:37:50.908 --> 00:37:51.939
I was...

640
00:37:53.609 --> 00:37:55.939
once ordinary just like Ji An.

641
00:37:56.778 --> 00:37:58.448
And this is the conclusion I came up with...

642
00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:00.778
after being married to your mother for 34 years.

643
00:38:02.178 --> 00:38:04.388
She will be living like me too.

644
00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:07.218
You mean...

645
00:38:07.388 --> 00:38:10.888
I also once believed love could overcome anything.

646
00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:14.798
I was pure and naive.

647
00:38:15.629 --> 00:38:18.198
I thought everything would be okay if I tried hard.

648
00:38:19.528 --> 00:38:20.939
For Haesung Corporation...

649
00:38:21.539 --> 00:38:22.568
I mean,

650
00:38:24.138 --> 00:38:25.539
for your grandfather and mother,

651
00:38:25.539 --> 00:38:27.709
I thought I should be able to do good enough.

652
00:38:28.638 --> 00:38:30.479
I was foolish and simple.

653
00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.149
This is surprising.

654
00:38:33.919 --> 00:38:36.118
I've never seen you have such a hard time.

655
00:38:39.888 --> 00:38:42.019
Do you think Ji An will let you see that?

656
00:38:45.888 --> 00:38:47.629
Since you ran away from home now,

657
00:38:48.229 --> 00:38:51.129
I just waited and watched you do as you please.

658
00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:54.238
But you lost to your grandfather as I expected.

659
00:38:54.868 --> 00:38:56.399
I didn't lose to him yet.

660
00:38:56.399 --> 00:38:58.138
He built his company into a corporation.

661
00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:00.479
It's not something that anyone can do.

662
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:02.879
You...

663
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:05.479
will never defeat your grandfather.

664
00:39:06.408 --> 00:39:07.979
I'm here to tell you that.

665
00:39:20.899 --> 00:39:21.928
Dad.

666
00:39:27.468 --> 00:39:29.839
Did you think we wouldn't find you here?

667
00:39:32.609 --> 00:39:34.109
Gosh, the air is so good.

668
00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:37.408
What... What are you doing here?

669
00:39:37.778 --> 00:39:40.948
I should check if your new place is good to live in.

670
00:39:40.948 --> 00:39:42.218
Ji Ho, go see if the room is warm enough.

671
00:39:42.218 --> 00:39:43.289
Okay.

672
00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:46.249
How did you come here?

673
00:39:47.988 --> 00:39:50.289
My grandfather used to live here.

674
00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:52.289
You lack imagination.

675
00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:56.459
He's an emergency patient, so the biopsy results...

676
00:39:56.459 --> 00:39:57.899
will be available tomorrow at around 5pm.

677
00:40:00.539 --> 00:40:01.899
The floor is warm.

678
00:40:04.209 --> 00:40:06.039
There's nothing here though.

679
00:40:08.479 --> 00:40:09.709
(My name is Seo Tae Soo. I hope it won't happen,)

680
00:40:09.709 --> 00:40:10.979
(but if you find me collapsed on the floor,)

681
00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:12.479
(please call Hyangrim Hospital or Yang Mi Jung.)

682
00:40:15.919 --> 00:40:16.919
Ji An.

683
00:40:20.388 --> 00:40:21.658
(My name is Seo Tae Soo. I hope it won't happen,)

684
00:40:21.658 --> 00:40:22.959
(but if you find me collapsed on the floor,)

685
00:40:22.959 --> 00:40:24.258
(please call Hyangrim Hospital or Yang Mi Jung.)

686
00:40:24.888 --> 00:40:26.598
It's getting cold inside. Just close the door.

687
00:40:27.798 --> 00:40:29.899
Ji Ho, close the door.

688
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:31.568
- Okay. - Bring the bowl with you.

689
00:40:31.568 --> 00:40:32.669
Okay.

690
00:40:34.638 --> 00:40:36.269
Just leave it. I'll do that.

691
00:40:36.269 --> 00:40:37.439
Wait. Leave it there.

692
00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:13.278
We see you're doing fine. We should get going then.

693
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:16.439
It's a five-minute walk to the bus station.

694
00:41:16.439 --> 00:41:18.479
Ji An said there were no buses around here before.

695
00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.919
I'm leaving, Dad. I should go to work tomorrow.

696
00:41:21.348 --> 00:41:22.618
Okay.

697
00:41:23.789 --> 00:41:24.818
Get some rest.

698
00:41:55.778 --> 00:41:56.789
You came.

699
00:42:00.158 --> 00:42:03.059
I'm not here to go with you for the surgery.

700
00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:07.859
I want a divorce.

701
00:42:09.499 --> 00:42:10.868
You win. I'll do as you please.

702
00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:14.539
But please...

703
00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:16.539
give birth to that baby.

704
00:42:17.508 --> 00:42:19.309
Then I will divorce you.

705
00:42:19.468 --> 00:42:20.609
Seo Ji Tae.

706
00:42:20.609 --> 00:42:21.778
I'm not asking you to raise our baby.

707
00:42:23.249 --> 00:42:24.448
I'll raise the baby myself.

708
00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:27.618
I'll call the police.

709
00:42:30.189 --> 00:42:31.749
You know it's illegal.

710
00:42:35.818 --> 00:42:37.229
What do you think you are doing?

711
00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:40.229
I did the math.

712
00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:43.629
We had the baby before the wedding ceremony.

713
00:42:44.769 --> 00:42:45.968
You know that, right?

714
00:42:45.968 --> 00:42:47.638
Why does that matter?

715
00:42:47.669 --> 00:42:49.238
I want us to be responsible...

716
00:42:49.798 --> 00:42:51.468
for our actions.

717
00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:54.539
So you'll have the baby,

718
00:42:55.238 --> 00:42:58.079
and I will raise the baby.

719
00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:02.079
Are you threatening me?

720
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.149
I don't want to ruin your life.

721
00:43:04.189 --> 00:43:07.118
You don't have to live a poor life.

722
00:43:10.428 --> 00:43:11.988
I can take paternity leave.

723
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:15.028
I'll take a year's paternity leave.

724
00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.798
There's a nursery near the Cheongju branch.

725
00:43:18.198 --> 00:43:19.698
I'll apply for that branch.

726
00:43:20.839 --> 00:43:21.968
You can just take...

727
00:43:21.968 --> 00:43:23.939
a two months' maternity leave.

728
00:43:23.939 --> 00:43:25.368
Then you'll be able to keep working.

729
00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:27.278
Ji Tae.

730
00:43:30.778 --> 00:43:32.048
So get in.

731
00:43:40.059 --> 00:43:41.859
You have my address. Please drive us there.

732
00:43:42.218 --> 00:43:43.258
Ji Tae.

733
00:43:43.258 --> 00:43:44.428
Don't say anything.

734
00:44:03.749 --> 00:44:04.809
You should go in.

735
00:44:06.948 --> 00:44:08.019
Here.

736
00:44:08.448 --> 00:44:10.749
It's your choice if you throw it away or not.

737
00:44:10.749 --> 00:44:12.118
Dad gave it to you.

738
00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:15.258
Between the baby and me,

739
00:44:15.388 --> 00:44:17.528
you chose the baby?

740
00:44:17.528 --> 00:44:19.528
You made me have no choice.

741
00:44:27.098 --> 00:44:28.098
Go.

742
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.368
I'll leave after I see you get in.

743
00:44:49.089 --> 00:44:50.129
Ji An.

744
00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.789
Did you see Dad's poster?

745
00:44:59.028 --> 00:45:01.039
He even found a sanatorium.

746
00:45:02.568 --> 00:45:04.939
It means he decided to die alone.

747
00:45:06.908 --> 00:45:08.778
I should get him a dresser in his room.

748
00:45:10.508 --> 00:45:13.519
But I'm glad I listened to you.

749
00:45:14.218 --> 00:45:15.948
Dad couldn't do anything.

750
00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:19.589
What if we don't tell him it's an imaginary cancer?

751
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:21.289
What do you mean?

752
00:45:22.089 --> 00:45:23.658
It doesn't matter to Dad...

753
00:45:23.658 --> 00:45:25.189
if the cancer is real or not.

754
00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.758
Dad wants to die after all.

755
00:45:27.798 --> 00:45:29.229
He's still deeply wounded.

756
00:45:29.698 --> 00:45:30.729
You're right.

757
00:45:31.368 --> 00:45:33.339
The doctor said he'll need psychotherapy.

758
00:45:33.738 --> 00:45:35.738
From all accounts we've heard from Dad,

759
00:45:36.298 --> 00:45:39.769
he believes all of us don't need him.

760
00:45:41.008 --> 00:45:42.879
Mom already showed it through her actions.

761
00:45:43.778 --> 00:45:45.008
And we did it too.

762
00:45:46.879 --> 00:45:48.348
I was the worst.

763
00:45:49.118 --> 00:45:51.419
I'm still worried though.

764
00:45:51.689 --> 00:45:54.158
If we tell Dad that it's not a cancer,

765
00:45:54.158 --> 00:45:55.658
and it's just a stress gastric ulcer,

766
00:45:56.258 --> 00:45:57.689
he'd be...

767
00:45:57.959 --> 00:45:59.689
so embarrassed.

768
00:45:59.689 --> 00:46:00.928
He couldn't be able to come back home.

769
00:46:01.899 --> 00:46:03.999
Then we should just let him believe...

770
00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:05.399
it's a stomach cancer?

771
00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:08.798
Ji Tae, do you remember how we treated Dad...

772
00:46:08.798 --> 00:46:10.809
before his business collapsed?

773
00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:15.539
Dad was always like a superhero to me.

774
00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:18.079
It's not just about money.

775
00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:20.048
"Dad, please tie my shoestrings."

776
00:46:20.048 --> 00:46:21.948
"Dad, I have a test tomorrow, but I'm sleepy."

777
00:46:21.948 --> 00:46:23.249
"Please stay with me."

778
00:46:24.048 --> 00:46:27.189
I used to go to bathhouses and hiking with him...

779
00:46:27.388 --> 00:46:28.988
every weekend.

780
00:46:30.229 --> 00:46:31.689
I also told him about my girlfriend.

781
00:46:32.428 --> 00:46:33.999
Sometimes, I talked about my mean senior.

782
00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.229
Dad told me one day.

783
00:46:38.169 --> 00:46:39.468
After his business collapsed,

784
00:46:40.769 --> 00:46:42.698
I didn't even look him in his eyes.

785
00:46:44.908 --> 00:46:45.968
That's true.

786
00:46:47.508 --> 00:46:49.109
"Dad, are you all right?"

787
00:46:49.879 --> 00:46:50.948
I never said that.

788
00:46:52.479 --> 00:46:53.848
I asked that every night...

789
00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.778
when his business was going well.

790
00:46:56.789 --> 00:47:00.459
I thought Dad didn't know anything.

791
00:47:01.488 --> 00:47:02.818
He always smiled.

792
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:06.859
He vented out his built-up resentments...

793
00:47:07.729 --> 00:47:09.629
because of me.

794
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:12.899
I can't leave him as he is now.

795
00:47:13.839 --> 00:47:15.339
If his imaginary cancer...

796
00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:17.068
was caused because he felt betrayed by his family,

797
00:47:17.408 --> 00:47:19.109
we should get rid of his sense of betrayal...

798
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:20.638
to make the symptoms go away.

799
00:47:21.278 --> 00:47:23.348
Do you want him to find it out himself?

800
00:47:35.158 --> 00:47:38.258
So? You lost 5,000 dollars like that?

801
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:39.758
Yes.

802
00:47:40.098 --> 00:47:42.428
It turns out Dad was right.

803
00:47:42.629 --> 00:47:44.098
I know I'm pathetic.

804
00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:48.568
Let's say you learned your lesson with that money.

805
00:47:49.339 --> 00:47:51.269
So what are you going to do now?

806
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:54.579
I want to start a business.

807
00:47:55.178 --> 00:47:58.048
Once I come up with a business plan,

808
00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:00.678
I'll work in the field for a year as Dad advised.

809
00:48:00.948 --> 00:48:03.318
But I don't know what to do yet.

810
00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:06.388
You should first think about...

811
00:48:06.388 --> 00:48:07.789
if you are good at running a business or not.

812
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:10.158
I'll have to try it then.

813
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:13.089
You can try it at the flea market or something.

814
00:48:14.129 --> 00:48:15.129
"Flea market"?

815
00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:21.798
I'll look up a flea market location tonight.

816
00:48:21.968 --> 00:48:23.709
I'll make the earrings.

817
00:48:23.908 --> 00:48:25.408
Can you make them in just a few days?

818
00:48:25.408 --> 00:48:27.479
I can even make at least 10 pairs of them tonight.

819
00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:28.709
You should look for nice clothes.

820
00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:30.008
Don't worry about that.

821
00:48:30.048 --> 00:48:32.348
I know where to get sponsored.

822
00:48:36.348 --> 00:48:38.249
You're going out early in the morning?

823
00:48:38.488 --> 00:48:42.718
Yes. I'm going to assist his baking regularly now.

824
00:48:42.818 --> 00:48:45.488
So I won't be able to join breakfast.

825
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:48.499
You don't need to do that.

826
00:48:48.999 --> 00:48:50.629
Quit that bakery now.

827
00:48:50.899 --> 00:48:51.968
Pardon?

828
00:48:53.129 --> 00:48:54.899
I was going to tell you anyway.

829
00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.839
We've decided to send you abroad.

830
00:48:58.039 --> 00:49:00.439
We've assigned a 24-hour bodyguard too.

831
00:49:00.609 --> 00:49:02.178
You can study baking abroad.

832
00:49:03.209 --> 00:49:04.979
Study... Study abroad?

833
00:49:05.408 --> 00:49:08.318
You should get better education.

834
00:49:08.848 --> 00:49:11.218
If you study baking as a patissier in France,

835
00:49:11.218 --> 00:49:14.118
I'll launch a bakery for you in FNB.

836
00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:16.388
You never said that before.

837
00:49:16.729 --> 00:49:18.658
You never asked me either.

838
00:49:18.658 --> 00:49:21.928
We chose Do Kyung and Seo Hyun's path too.

839
00:49:21.928 --> 00:49:23.468
I don't want to go abroad.

840
00:49:23.798 --> 00:49:25.269
Why should I?

841
00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.669
Ji Soo.

842
00:49:26.669 --> 00:49:30.939
I'm telling you now. I don't want to go abroad.

843
00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:33.278
This is so unfair.

844
00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:36.039
How could you just notify me...

845
00:49:36.379 --> 00:49:38.579
without discussing it with me?

846
00:49:39.379 --> 00:49:40.948
That's the rule in this family.

847
00:49:42.348 --> 00:49:44.649
You like baking. What's the matter?

848
00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:47.618
You're not sending me abroad for that reason.

849
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:50.959
You're trying to make me study...

850
00:49:51.189 --> 00:49:53.499
so I wouldn't humiliate this family.

851
00:49:53.959 --> 00:49:56.098
You're not concerned even a bit...

852
00:49:56.298 --> 00:49:58.028
about my opinions, intentions, or dreams.

853
00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:01.339
But your education isn't enough for us,

854
00:50:01.339 --> 00:50:03.098
and it's right to fill what you lack.

855
00:50:04.539 --> 00:50:06.368
I'm going to book a ticket by next week,

856
00:50:06.809 --> 00:50:08.008
so keep that in mind.

857
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:09.079
No.

858
00:50:09.479 --> 00:50:10.579
I'm not going.

859
00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.448
- Hey. - I'll never leave.

860
00:50:15.678 --> 00:50:16.749
No?

861
00:50:16.749 --> 00:50:19.388
You have no right to make me study abroad.

862
00:50:20.488 --> 00:50:23.289
I have a right to choose for my own life.

863
00:50:23.758 --> 00:50:26.798
I couldn't understand it until now.

864
00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:29.459
Why do you think that conglomerates...

865
00:50:29.758 --> 00:50:31.229
are special?

866
00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.499
- What? - How are they special?

867
00:50:33.738 --> 00:50:36.138
You just have more money than other people.

868
00:50:36.439 --> 00:50:38.169
You still eat three meals a day.

869
00:50:38.169 --> 00:50:39.738
You always ordered me around.

870
00:50:39.738 --> 00:50:42.508
Manners and pride. I never liked any of it.

871
00:50:42.678 --> 00:50:45.408
I could never sleep well since I moved in here.

872
00:50:45.408 --> 00:50:47.419
That's a military academy rather than home.

873
00:50:47.649 --> 00:50:49.019
- Seo Ji Soo. - Yes.

874
00:50:49.548 --> 00:50:51.249
Yes. I'm Seo Ji Soo.

875
00:50:51.488 --> 00:50:53.048
I lived as Seo Ji Soo,

876
00:50:53.118 --> 00:50:55.019
and I want to stay that way.

877
00:50:55.988 --> 00:50:59.729
I want to be Seo Ji Soo, who was always loved.

878
00:51:54.718 --> 00:51:55.948
("Second Pathfinder Opens Next Month.")

879
00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:07.258
Why are you here at this hour?

880
00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:09.598
Are you here because you're worried?

881
00:52:10.269 --> 00:52:12.399
Well, I had work to do.

882
00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:16.068
What are you doing here at this hour?

883
00:52:16.468 --> 00:52:19.609
Yong Gook took my laptop, so I'm using this one.

884
00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:55.209
What are you doing? Do you want me to help you?

885
00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:56.609
No.

886
00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:02.579
What are you doing?

887
00:53:02.778 --> 00:53:05.318
I'm using what they're going to throw out anyway.

888
00:53:06.448 --> 00:53:10.658
I heard I can upcycle wood pieces and sawdust.

889
00:53:10.859 --> 00:53:12.189
Was it called "pellets"?

890
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:16.798
Are you looking for something to upcycle?

891
00:53:17.568 --> 00:53:19.229
Tell me. What kind of wood are you looking for?

892
00:53:23.098 --> 00:53:25.109
You shouldn't go through sawdust in bare hands.

893
00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:26.638
What will that do to your hands?

894
00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:30.149
It's fine since I like it. My hands don't matter.

895
00:53:30.249 --> 00:53:33.479
Why do you like this? I don't understand you.

896
00:53:33.749 --> 00:53:36.249
I'd get it if you have a job.

897
00:53:36.249 --> 00:53:37.919
But look at what you're doing now.

898
00:53:38.118 --> 00:53:40.459
Why would you refuse to be a wife of Haesung?

899
00:53:44.959 --> 00:53:47.698
Do you feel inferior because you can't be one?

900
00:53:50.399 --> 00:53:52.298
This is why I can never date you.

901
00:53:52.528 --> 00:53:54.439
We have nothing in common.

902
00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:56.939
I don't like you anymore. Don't even think about it.

903
00:53:57.468 --> 00:53:59.309
I wasn't planning to.

904
00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:04.278
Why won't you get upset?

905
00:54:04.649 --> 00:54:07.479
Why are you happy when I'm like this?

906
00:54:10.089 --> 00:54:11.548
You weren't planning to?

907
00:54:11.689 --> 00:54:13.048
You're not going to do anything with me?

908
00:54:13.289 --> 00:54:14.919
Then why did you send me that picture?

909
00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:17.129
Why did you send me your picture in Incheon?

910
00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:18.829
Why did you leave the bag?

911
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:20.459
You kept making me worry.

912
00:54:20.729 --> 00:54:21.928
Did you do that on purpose?

913
00:54:21.928 --> 00:54:23.928
Weren't you trying to get me involved?

914
00:54:26.399 --> 00:54:27.769
Explain all that one by one.

915
00:54:28.039 --> 00:54:29.968
Why didn't you come pick up your bag?

916
00:54:29.968 --> 00:54:31.638
Did you want me to bring it back to you?

917
00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:34.209
Why did you overreact when I visited you?

918
00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:35.879
You know that'd stimulate me.

919
00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:37.778
Why did you go to Incheon?

920
00:54:37.778 --> 00:54:39.548
You called Sunwoo Hyuk anyway.

921
00:54:40.548 --> 00:54:42.178
You sent a sign to both of us, right?

922
00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.318
You sent me a picture. What did you send to him?

923
00:54:44.519 --> 00:54:47.359
Oh, and why did you call him?

924
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:49.959
Do you like him? You like me.

925
00:54:50.189 --> 00:54:53.428
Why would you call someone who likes you then?

926
00:54:53.528 --> 00:54:54.959
You shouldn't behave like that.

927
00:54:54.959 --> 00:54:58.098
I tried to initialize the phone and dump it...

928
00:54:58.229 --> 00:55:01.339
because you bought it for me,

929
00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:02.899
but...

930
00:55:03.368 --> 00:55:06.809
I found a photo of you that you told me to take.

931
00:55:07.508 --> 00:55:09.408
I only sent the picture...

932
00:55:09.508 --> 00:55:11.548
because it's yours.

933
00:55:12.178 --> 00:55:14.678
And I didn't know I left my bag.

934
00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:16.848
You don't know because you weren't there.

935
00:55:17.318 --> 00:55:18.818
I got kicked out so fast.

936
00:55:19.019 --> 00:55:21.019
Why are you so firm?

937
00:55:21.488 --> 00:55:23.829
Why do you act like you mean what you say?

938
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:27.559
Why are you going through sawdust looking all happy?

939
00:55:29.729 --> 00:55:31.368
See? You're not upset again.

940
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:33.839
Do you know how hard it is to put up with you?

941
00:55:34.068 --> 00:55:36.868
How can you ignore me like this?

942
00:55:37.339 --> 00:55:38.368
Stop it.

943
00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:40.809
Stop what? You do whatever you like to do.

944
00:55:41.339 --> 00:55:42.738
I took your father to the hospital...

945
00:55:42.738 --> 00:55:44.109
when he collapsed at our office.

946
00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:46.948
Your father searched the terminal with your photo.

947
00:55:46.948 --> 00:55:49.118
He went through dead women in police station.

948
00:55:49.348 --> 00:55:51.548
So I told him you're in Yeonnam-dong.

949
00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:53.789
Then what did you do? You yelled at me.

950
00:55:53.888 --> 00:55:55.258
Police station?

951
00:55:55.459 --> 00:55:57.559
I'm disappointed in you too.

952
00:55:58.089 --> 00:55:59.388
He went through...

953
00:56:00.598 --> 00:56:01.629
dead women?

954
00:56:04.899 --> 00:56:07.738
Hey. I mean...

955
00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:11.008
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that, okay?

956
00:56:13.238 --> 00:56:14.238
It's okay.

957
00:56:21.979 --> 00:56:23.118
I should say...

958
00:56:23.848 --> 00:56:25.289
something I haven't said.

959
00:56:27.988 --> 00:56:29.559
Thank you...

960
00:56:30.528 --> 00:56:32.129
for telling my dad.

961
00:56:33.959 --> 00:56:35.198
Thank you...

962
00:56:37.098 --> 00:56:38.568
for taking care of my dad.

963
00:56:44.169 --> 00:56:45.209
I think...

964
00:56:46.368 --> 00:56:48.778
I've said and heard everything I need.

965
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:52.649
I need to focus, so stop talking to me.

966
00:56:55.149 --> 00:56:56.649
Hey. Seo Ji An.

967
00:56:56.848 --> 00:56:58.618
Do I look funny to you?

968
00:56:59.019 --> 00:57:00.718
Just because I like you...

969
00:57:09.999 --> 00:57:11.229
What's wrong with me?

970
00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:13.198
Why am I being so childish?

971
00:57:37.129 --> 00:57:38.229
Aren't you hungry?

972
00:57:38.658 --> 00:57:40.899
What? You're still here?

973
00:57:40.899 --> 00:57:42.258
Why didn't you leave?

974
00:57:42.329 --> 00:57:43.968
I told you that I'm using the laptop.

975
00:57:44.298 --> 00:57:47.039
Did you not have dinner?

976
00:57:47.039 --> 00:57:48.198
No, I didn't.

977
00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:50.669
Do you even know what time it is?

978
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:31.379
I tried to initialize the phone and dump it...

979
00:58:31.408 --> 00:58:34.649
because you bought it for me.

980
00:58:36.278 --> 00:58:38.988
She tried to initialize the phone and dump it?

981
00:58:39.689 --> 00:58:41.218
She tried to erase any trace of herself?

982
00:58:43.359 --> 00:58:45.359
It's the result of Ji An's phone location.

983
00:58:47.098 --> 00:58:49.198
It lost signal a week ago.

984
00:58:49.258 --> 00:58:51.899
The last signal was caught in Incheon.

985
00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:54.698
She went to Incheon without a wallet...

986
00:58:55.568 --> 00:58:58.309
and dumped the phone after resetting it?

987
00:58:59.879 --> 00:59:00.908
Why?

988
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:03.309
Are you playing with Ji An when you can't...

989
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:04.348
take responsibility?

990
00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:06.408
What if I take the responsibility?

991
00:59:06.579 --> 00:59:08.048
If you could...

992
00:59:08.048 --> 00:59:10.089
You were her brother once.

993
00:59:11.289 --> 00:59:13.818
How could you leave her like that at the end?

994
00:59:13.818 --> 00:59:15.388
Let me ask you a favor.

995
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:18.258
Don't disturb Ji An.

996
00:59:18.758 --> 00:59:20.028
She just got back to herself.

997
00:59:20.028 --> 00:59:21.499
Leave her be.

998
00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.859
If you really care about her.

999
00:59:26.468 --> 00:59:27.468
I've...

1000
00:59:28.868 --> 00:59:30.769
overcome my time between life and death.

1001
00:59:31.738 --> 00:59:34.039
So I know now. I do.

1002
00:59:36.008 --> 00:59:37.379
I know where I belong,

1003
00:59:37.848 --> 00:59:39.278
how I am,

1004
00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:42.118
and where I should be to be happy.

1005
00:59:59.399 --> 01:00:01.598
Ji Soo left early in the morning.

1006
01:00:04.138 --> 01:00:05.309
Why?

1007
01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:08.778
She's going to assist baking at the bakery.

1008
01:00:09.278 --> 01:00:10.309
My goodness.

1009
01:00:11.379 --> 01:00:13.218
I guess it really fits her.

1010
01:00:14.479 --> 01:00:15.519
I know.

1011
01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:39.238
Ji Soo.

1012
01:00:39.979 --> 01:00:41.339
Why are you here so early?

1013
01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:44.649
You said you waited since the day before.

1014
01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:47.278
You're smart. That's great.

1015
01:00:47.278 --> 01:00:49.778
Then shall we start now?

1016
01:00:53.118 --> 01:00:54.158
Paddle.

1017
01:00:57.888 --> 01:00:59.089
Here you go.

1018
01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:03.129
Where are you going? Let me drive you.

1019
01:01:03.129 --> 01:01:05.098
No. I want to go alone.

1020
01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:07.499
Thank you for letting me use your car.

1021
01:01:32.028 --> 01:01:34.899
Buy squids.

1022
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:40.399
Hello there. Are you looking for squids?

1023
01:01:41.068 --> 01:01:43.809
Is the laver field open today?

1024
01:01:43.809 --> 01:01:46.068
Not today because of the bad weather.

1025
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:47.309
My goodness.

1026
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:49.638
You're the handsome boy who came last time.

1027
01:01:50.178 --> 01:01:51.178
Do you know me?

1028
01:01:51.178 --> 01:01:53.448
You were looking for Ms. Seo.

1029
01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.649
Haven't you met her yet?

1030
01:01:55.948 --> 01:01:57.488
Well, about her.

1031
01:01:57.618 --> 01:02:00.559
How did Ms. Seo get to work in laver field?

1032
01:02:05.258 --> 01:02:06.698
Excuse me.

1033
01:02:09.399 --> 01:02:10.399
Who are you?

1034
01:02:11.868 --> 01:02:13.868
I'm here to find something out.

1035
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:25.178
Well, who are you...

1036
01:02:25.178 --> 01:02:26.649
to ask me about Ms. Seo?

1037
01:02:26.649 --> 01:02:28.479
You told Sunwoo Hyuk about her.

1038
01:02:28.948 --> 01:02:30.388
The one who took Ji An.

1039
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:34.118
That's because he was here first.

1040
01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:36.019
I had to explain what was going on.

1041
01:02:36.859 --> 01:02:39.528
I was a step behind back then.

1042
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:41.499
Right after Ji An left with him.

1043
01:02:43.428 --> 01:02:44.829
How's Ms. Seo doing?

1044
01:02:45.568 --> 01:02:48.839
Yes. She said she's happy.

1045
01:02:49.238 --> 01:02:50.439
Then that's enough.

1046
01:02:50.669 --> 01:02:53.138
Why would you want to talk about it now?

1047
01:02:53.238 --> 01:02:55.109
She doesn't open up to me.

1048
01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.879
I thought I might find the answer here.

1049
01:02:58.848 --> 01:03:00.379
She said she had overcome...

1050
01:03:00.678 --> 01:03:01.848
her time between life and death.

1051
01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:07.818
Are you the reason...

1052
01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:09.959
she ended up coming here?

1053
01:03:10.658 --> 01:03:13.658
I was one of her many reasons.

1054
01:03:25.339 --> 01:03:26.539
Do you see that mountain?

1055
01:03:27.138 --> 01:03:29.379
I found her near the top of that mountain.

1056
01:03:30.408 --> 01:03:31.908
She collapsed after taking medicine.

1057
01:03:33.649 --> 01:03:34.948
I was going to let her go,

1058
01:03:34.948 --> 01:03:36.448
but she seemed she'd do it again.

1059
01:03:36.718 --> 01:03:38.289
That's why I kept her and made her work...

1060
01:03:38.289 --> 01:03:39.649
so she wouldn't think about anything else.

1061
01:03:45.028 --> 01:03:46.129
She tried to die?

1062
01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:49.359
Not even a cellphone or an ID.

1063
01:03:49.528 --> 01:03:50.829
She had nothing.

1064
01:03:51.899 --> 01:03:53.439
Unless her friend...

1065
01:03:53.439 --> 01:03:55.868
found her accidentally when he came to buy laver,

1066
01:03:56.368 --> 01:03:58.769
she would've died here while drying laver.

1067
01:03:59.408 --> 01:04:02.339
She refused to go even when her friend was here.

1068
01:04:02.508 --> 01:04:03.908
He had to persuade her for several days.

1069
01:04:31.439 --> 01:04:33.008
Why do you care?

1070
01:04:34.178 --> 01:04:37.178
Hyuk. Get him off me.

1071
01:04:37.178 --> 01:04:38.948
I don't know why he's doing this.

1072
01:05:34.939 --> 01:05:35.968
Ji An.

1073
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:46.149
Ji An.

1074
01:06:24.249 --> 01:06:26.818
(My Golden Life)

1075
01:06:28.888 --> 01:06:29.888
Ji An.

1076
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:31.629
Is he your brother?

1077
01:06:31.629 --> 01:06:32.928
You met my brother?

1078
01:06:32.928 --> 01:06:35.198
Then who's Seo Ji Soo?

1079
01:06:35.999 --> 01:06:38.399
But I have plans today.

1080
01:06:38.468 --> 01:06:39.999
With whom? Sunwoo Hyuk?

1081
01:06:40.399 --> 01:06:41.468
What are you doing here?

1082
01:06:41.468 --> 01:06:43.269
Why would you come here one by one?

1083
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:44.769
Please stop this now.

1084
01:06:44.769 --> 01:06:46.109
What happened with Do Kyung?

1085
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:47.178
Have you found the girl?

1086
01:06:47.339 --> 01:06:48.339
Not yet.

1087
01:06:48.479 --> 01:06:50.579
It's Vice Chairman Choi Do Kyung's address.

1088
01:06:50.579 --> 01:06:51.609
Ji An.

1089
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.548
I'm sorry I didn't know.

1090
01:06:53.618 --> 01:06:55.348
I get why we can't work it out now.

1091
01:06:55.348 --> 01:06:57.519
From now on, I'll make you feel easy.
