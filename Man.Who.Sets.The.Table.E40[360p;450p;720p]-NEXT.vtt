00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.120
(Episode 40)

2
00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.620
We don't have any results today.

3
00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:15.500
We only found out that the chairman 
really trusts the director.

4
00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:17.340
We can't trust him.

5
00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:20.410
The enemy is always near you.

6
00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.540
But seeing that he said to throw Ae Ri out,

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.600
he must be sincere to the chairman.

8
00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.650
I'm not going to trust anyone until 
I see the security footage.

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.020
Wait a minute.

10
00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:36.350
It's the nurse.

11
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.620
Yes.

12
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.060
What? There's a witness?

13
00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.430
Okay, we'll go to the hospital right now.

14
00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:52.270
Let's go.

15
00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:08.190
Jung Tae Yang has the security footage 
from the hospital.

16
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:09.960
We have to stop him no matter what.

17
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.670
Everything was too meticulous
 for one woman to carry out.

18
00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:30.110
I'm sure that she has an accomplice.

19
00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:31.840
Her name is Lee Ru Ri.

20
00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.810
She assisted Jung Tae Yang during
 the competition.

21
00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:38.140
She doesn't have the ability 
and qualifications.

22
00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:40.510
She's become an employee 
after doing the internship...

23
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.620
thanks to Jung Tae Yang.

24
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.120
In short,

25
00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.520
she's using him as a stepping stone to success.

26
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.330
She's very ambitious.

27
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.810
That's ridiculous.

28
00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:07.680
What's ridiculous?

29
00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:10.480
It can't be the director, can it?

30
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.690
Are you talking about the accomplice that's helping Joo Ae Ri?

31
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.600
Woo Joo.

32
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:33.200
Yes?

33
00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.530
Do you remember that man?

34
00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.540
The man we saw when we went to Joo Ae Ri's place.

35
00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.810
Yes, what about him?

36
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.680
Could he be the person that Tae Yang is trying to find?

37
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:47.120
No matter how hard I think, I think it's the director.

38
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.280
He was the reason why Kevin and I had a misunderstanding...

39
00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:52.550
towards Lee Ru Ri and Lee Shin Mo.

40
00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:54.490
He would always take Joo Ae Ri's side.

41
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:57.460
He even investigated Lee Shin Mo for Kevin.

42
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.500
He was the one who acquired the recording of Jung Su Mi.

43
00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:03.560
You're saying that the truth was very distorted...

44
00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.770
after hearing Lee Shin Mo in person, right?

45
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.570
I think he was anxious to connect...

46
00:03:08.572 --> 00:03:11.940
Tae Yang and Ae Ri from the start.

47
00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.810
That can't be true.

48
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.510
He's the founding member of SC Food and Beverage.

49
00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:18.620
He's the right-hand man of Kevin.

50
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:20.850
Mom.

51
00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.720
Does Joo Ae Ri have a dad?

52
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:28.450
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

53
00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.460
Kevin adopted her because she doesn't have parents.

54
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.490
We saw a middle-aged man who came to see her...

55
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:36.800
when we went to her place.

56
00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.840
He would have to be really close to visit her in the daytime.

57
00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.170
A middle-aged man?

58
00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:45.340
Eun Byul, do you remember what he looks like?

59
00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:46.780
Wait a minute.

60
00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.080
Is he among here?

61
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.120
It's this person.

62
00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:57.790
That's right, that's him.

63
00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:01.660
Kids are right. Isn't it suspicious that he met...

64
00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.830
Joo Ae Ri at her place when he should've been at work?

65
00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:08.170
We need to be careful.

66
00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:10.030
Just like Kevin,

67
00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.760
he would have seen Joo Ae Ri for over 20 years.

68
00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.070
He could have taken her side because of past affection.

69
00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:19.040
We need more definite proof to be suspicious of him.

70
00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:20.680
Definite proof?

71
00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:23.010
How could we find that?

72
00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:25.780
He's so loyal to Kevin.

73
00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:49.140
What's wrong?

74
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.270
I'm sorry, but I don't think I will be able to see you tonight.

75
00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:54.150
I came to see Ae Ri at the hospital.

76
00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.310
Okay, don't worry. I'm going to sleep soon.

77
00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:59.420
Did something good happen?

78
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.950
You sound better.

79
00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:04.520
Yes.

80
00:05:04.754 --> 00:05:07.290
Tae Yang decided to come back to the company.

81
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.460
That's good. I'm so happy.

82
00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.270
Yes, I couldn't ask for more.

83
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.770
Please take good care of Ae Ri.

84
00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.220
Nurse.

85
00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:34.810
That was fast. I was waiting for you.

86
00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:37.080
We're sorry to bother you.

87
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.450
Thank you so much.

88
00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:39.580
You're welcome.

89
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.590
Like you said, a life depends on this.

90
00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.960
Is the witness a nurse?

91
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.190
Yes, she was on maternity leave.

92
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:49.130
We couldn't find a witness at first because of that.

93
00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:50.900
She returned.

94
00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:52.270
Let's go.

95
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.980
A witness?

96
00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:06.410
(Mr. Jung Tae Yang)

97
00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:12.720
So you saw the man in question on the day of the incident?

98
00:07:12.816 --> 00:07:17.160
Yes, I remember him clearly because he almost hurt me.

99
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.460
Please describe him.

100
00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:23.230
It was the last day of work before my maternity leave.

101
00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.060
I was on my way to start my evening shift around 10:30pm.

102
00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.770
I heard the emergency alarm from the ward.

103
00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.540
I ran to the ward just in case.

104
00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:38.580
Excuse me, what were you doing...

105
00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:46.350
Were you able to take a good look at his face?

106
00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:47.580
Of course.

107
00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:50.580
That man must've been flustered too. Our eyes met.

108
00:07:50.587 --> 00:07:51.920
It was a man?

109
00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:53.960
How old was he?

110
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.600
He was young. He looked like he was in his early 30s.

111
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.460
How did he look?

112
00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:01.670
He was quite tall.

113
00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:03.470
Was he about 180cm tall?

114
00:08:03.766 --> 00:08:07.040
He was slim, had fair skin, and had big eyes.

115
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.540
He had double eyelids too.

116
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.980
Did he visit the chairman before?

117
00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:17.420
No. Since he stayed in the VIP Ward, I'd remember the visitors,

118
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.580
but I've never seen him before.

119
00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:25.720
You'd be able to recognize him if you see him again, right?

120
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:27.450
Of course,

121
00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:30.530
but would he come back to the hospital?

122
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.780
Don't let it disappoint you.

123
00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:51.280
We'll get the security footage tomorrow.

124
00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:54.920
We'll find the man once we check it with what she told us.

125
00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:59.320
I thought that it could be Director Park, but I guess I was wrong.

126
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.700
I also thought it could be him too.

127
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.200
He has a long history with Joo Ae Ri.

128
00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:10.940
But he wouldn't gain anything if the chairman passes away, right?

129
00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:14.770
It's the contrary. If there's a new chairman, he might lose his job.

130
00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:16.370
I know.

131
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.810
A young guy.

132
00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:21.610
Who on earth is that?

133
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.050
Did Joo Ae Ri instigate him to do that?

134
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:27.020
Let's wait for the security footage.

135
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.000
Hold on.

136
00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.530
Yes?

137
00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:21.540
Pardon? Okay.

138
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.880
He just showed up. I'll be back.

139
00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:27.210
Let me come with you then.

140
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.450
No, it's dangerous. Stay in the car.

141
00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:40.290
What? There is a witness?

142
00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:43.030
That's what I heard.

143
00:10:44.327 --> 00:10:46.400
How could you make such a mistake?

144
00:10:47.463 --> 00:10:50.000
If Jung Tae Yang finds out everything...

145
00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:51.900
Don't worry.

146
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.310
It will be hard to find him with just the witness' statement.

147
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.150
You should just focus on your job. Why are you here?

148
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.920
I came because my curiosity got the better of me.

149
00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:15.860
You told me to stay away from the company.

150
00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:17.900
How are things going?

151
00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:20.530
Have you gone mad?

152
00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:22.570
We'll talk later. Get out of here now.

153
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.400
Come on. Don't be like that.

154
00:11:26.169 --> 00:11:29.010
I already took care of the security footage.

155
00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:31.810
Don't worry about it.

156
00:11:34.043 --> 00:11:36.810
There's a nurse who claims to have seen you.

157
00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:39.580
What?

158
00:11:40.183 --> 00:11:41.520
Darn.

159
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.550
Ma'am, where is that jerk?

160
00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:51.030
That man went to Room 606.

161
00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:53.400
Thank you.

162
00:11:58.668 --> 00:12:00.270
(606, Patient: Joo Ae Ri)

163
00:12:14.851 --> 00:12:16.250
What brings you here?

164
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.620
Are you here because you're worried about Ae Ri?

165
00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:06.900
Mr. Kim resigned a long time ago. Why is he here?

166
00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:25.990
Didn't a man come out just now?

167
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:27.350
Yes.

168
00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:28.660
Did you see him?

169
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:30.160
It was Mr. Kim.

170
00:13:30.593 --> 00:13:32.360
Is he the man we are looking for?

171
00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:40.770
See and tell us if this is the guy you saw.

172
00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:46.900
Yes, it's him. He was here a while ago too.

173
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:48.650
I'm certain this is the guy.

174
00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:08.370
- I will live for you - I will live for you

175
00:14:08.464 --> 00:14:12.100
- I will smile for you - I will smile for you

176
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:16.070
- Let's live a happy life - Let's live a happy life

177
00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:19.410
- No matter what people say - No matter what people say

178
00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:23.010
- In the end, it's my life - In the end, it's my life

179
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:26.520
How strange.

180
00:14:27.817 --> 00:14:31.120
Once a beauty, always a beauty.

181
00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:36.530
When people get old, their voices get rough first.

182
00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:41.030
She still has a ringing voice.

183
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.770
How can she still be slim and look young?

184
00:14:46.535 --> 00:14:49.930
She didn't get Botox injections...

185
00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:52.410
or anything like that, right?

186
00:14:58.214 --> 00:15:00.990
Hey, Young Hye.

187
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.520
You thought you were the prettiest in this world, right?

188
00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:08.360
People should've seen the way she looked that time.

189
00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:12.560
Her eyes...

190
00:15:12.695 --> 00:15:15.900
narrowed like a cat's.

191
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.870
She was burning with jealousy.

192
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.150
Shin Mo, I had a great time today.

193
00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.550
Your wife must have good karma.

194
00:15:33.783 --> 00:15:37.120
She has a handsome gentleman as her husband.

195
00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:42.690
A handsome gentleman?

196
00:15:44.427 --> 00:15:48.670
You said we can spend all day together now that you're retired.

197
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:54.110
No, that's why I can't live with you.

198
00:15:54.603 --> 00:15:57.640
The thought of spending the whole day with you...

199
00:15:57.907 --> 00:15:59.740
makes it hard for me to breathe.

200
00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:04.420
Hey, Young Hye. Did you learn your lesson now?

201
00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:08.420
I'm not a bad husband. You're the one with the problem.

202
00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:11.490
You're a bad judge of men.

203
00:16:15.925 --> 00:16:18.760
Okay. I had fun too.

204
00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:20.930
Your husband...

205
00:16:21.697 --> 00:16:25.540
must have saved the universe, not the nation, in his former life.

206
00:16:33.943 --> 00:16:36.280
Who would come here late at night?

207
00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:44.050
Oh, my. Why did you come here so late at night?

208
00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:47.320
Just take this.

209
00:16:47.323 --> 00:16:49.290
Did something happen?

210
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:50.590
No, no.

211
00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:54.090
When I got into my bed to sleep,

212
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.430
I got this godly feeling...

213
00:16:56.432 --> 00:17:00.040
that I must take care of the lonely in-law.

214
00:17:00.836 --> 00:17:02.470
Godly?

215
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:04.380
Yes, like a superhuman power.

216
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.170
You had ramyeon for dinner, right?

217
00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:10.270
What? You must really have a superhuman power.

218
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.040
How did you know?

219
00:17:12.048 --> 00:17:13.610
And you ate it with...

220
00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.690
radish and cabbage kimchi that you bought from a store?

221
00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:21.130
Oh, my.

222
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:23.430
Are you home, Ru Ri?

223
00:17:27.363 --> 00:17:28.730
Oh, my.

224
00:17:34.403 --> 00:17:35.670
I...

225
00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:44.720
Hello?

226
00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:46.480
Why do you sound scared?

227
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.190
What's the matter?

228
00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:51.450
There must have been a burglar at my house.

229
00:17:51.454 --> 00:17:52.720
What?

230
00:17:53.222 --> 00:17:56.360
Young Hye, stay still. I'll go there right away.

231
00:18:07.203 --> 00:18:10.200
Are Han Gyul and So Won well?

232
00:18:10.206 --> 00:18:12.670
Oh, no problem.

233
00:18:12.675 --> 00:18:16.140
They are a happy family now.

234
00:18:16.145 --> 00:18:19.980
And Han Gyul is doing great.

235
00:18:19.982 --> 00:18:22.650
She's not shy even though she hasn't lived there for long.

236
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:25.750
She even tries to fight me and get even with me.

237
00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:28.920
She's like a little version of Yang Chun Ok.

238
00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:30.830
Thank you.

239
00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:34.090
Thank you for accepting even her misbehavior.

240
00:18:34.096 --> 00:18:36.430
Why would you say that?

241
00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:38.400
Doctor Lee is like my son now.

242
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.400
His daughter is my daughter too. Of course, I'd be nice to her.

243
00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:43.800
I'm a little upset to hear that from you.

244
00:18:43.806 --> 00:18:46.310
Of course. Thank you so much.

245
00:18:49.245 --> 00:18:50.550
By the way,

246
00:18:50.946 --> 00:18:54.210
did you go meet your wife after dressing up...

247
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:57.180
and try to make amends?

248
00:18:57.186 --> 00:19:00.720
I was really curious.

249
00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:02.150
Well, no.

250
00:19:02.158 --> 00:19:05.960
I don't care if she receives a car as a present...

251
00:19:05.961 --> 00:19:08.190
or if she cheats on me.

252
00:19:08.197 --> 00:19:12.070
Now that I don't care about her, I feel so free now.

253
00:19:13.636 --> 00:19:15.970
Oh my goodness.

254
00:19:16.138 --> 00:19:19.200
You were so jealous before, and it seemed like...

255
00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:21.210
you might do something rash.

256
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.620
Why did you stop caring about her?

257
00:19:34.123 --> 00:19:36.020
Gosh, mind your manners.

258
00:19:36.025 --> 00:19:39.190
I'm talking. Why are you smiling at the phone?

259
00:19:39.195 --> 00:19:40.860
You're so ill-behaved.

260
00:19:40.863 --> 00:19:42.230
Theresa.

261
00:19:42.298 --> 00:19:44.940
"I look forward to seeing you tomorrow."

262
00:19:44.967 --> 00:19:46.500
"Goodnight, honey."

263
00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:47.910
"Honey"?

264
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.430
Honey as in food?

265
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:54.580
Give that back. Why would you steal my phone?

266
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:56.650
Mr. Lee.

267
00:19:57.646 --> 00:19:59.720
Are you cheating on your wife?

268
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:03.120
With a girl who says cheesy things like that?

269
00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:07.220
I'm not cheating. It's not like that.

270
00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:10.350
It's just someone I knew...

271
00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:13.400
back in college.

272
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:17.700
You should look at me in the eye and say that again.

273
00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:23.670
Is it a one-time thing, or is it love?

274
00:20:24.173 --> 00:20:27.210
What are you even talking about?

275
00:20:27.276 --> 00:20:29.010
Recently, I've heard many people...

276
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:33.080
fall in dangerous love affairs with their old classmates.

277
00:20:33.082 --> 00:20:36.320
Have you fallen in such dirty love too?

278
00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:38.280
"Dirty love"?

279
00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:40.680
Are you having an affair?

280
00:20:40.689 --> 00:20:43.990
Neither that woman nor you have divorced yet.

281
00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.160
If you two date like that,

282
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:48.730
that's called "dirty love".

283
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:51.460
Gosh, Mrs. Yang.

284
00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:54.230
It's not like that.

285
00:20:54.236 --> 00:20:57.970
We just went back to the pure period of our lives...

286
00:20:57.973 --> 00:21:00.640
with pure minds, visited "Cafe 7080" near Hongik University,

287
00:21:00.643 --> 00:21:03.010
had beer, and sang together.

288
00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:06.680
That's not dirty love.

289
00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:08.410
Is that true?

290
00:21:08.417 --> 00:21:11.450
Of course. We didn't even hold hands yet.

291
00:21:11.453 --> 00:21:13.320
See?

292
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.950
You just said you didn't hold hands yet.

293
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.660
That means there's a possibility...

294
00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:21.430
that it could become something more in the future.

295
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.130
No, no. That's... That's not what I meant.

296
00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:28.170
You know that I'm called "Silver Knife" in Cheongdam-dong, right?

297
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.970
I can forgive everything else,

298
00:21:29.972 --> 00:21:32.600
but I never forgive people who cheat.

299
00:21:32.608 --> 00:21:35.710
If I find out you're cheating, I'll slice you with my silver knife.

300
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.610
- Be careful. - Why do you only threaten me?

301
00:21:38.614 --> 00:21:41.710
If you want to scold someone, you need to scold Young Hye.

302
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:45.450
I only had beer, but she received a car from him.

303
00:21:45.454 --> 00:21:47.180
Look here, Mr. Lee.

304
00:21:47.189 --> 00:21:51.430
How come a man like you have such a small heart?

305
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.590
She's seeing him because she needs him for money.

306
00:21:55.597 --> 00:21:58.400
You're just dating for fun.

307
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.370
Be careful. I won't let you do this.

308
00:22:01.704 --> 00:22:04.300
- Gosh. - I... Gosh.

309
00:22:04.306 --> 00:22:06.240
- Gosh. - I...

310
00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:10.680
How can she discriminate against me like that?

311
00:22:10.946 --> 00:22:14.610
This isn't dirty love.

312
00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:18.960
I met her as a friend with a pure heart.

313
00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:23.650
Wait a moment. Should I take Theresa on a drive...

314
00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:26.660
and take her to the Bugak Skyway?

315
00:22:29.031 --> 00:22:30.930
Wait a moment.

316
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:37.740
Gosh.

317
00:22:38.173 --> 00:22:42.580
Why is the seat belt on my car so properly fixed?

318
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:44.650
Gosh.

319
00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:51.450
It's finished. You don't need to worry when you leave home now.

320
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:52.820
Thank you.

321
00:22:54.723 --> 00:22:56.390
Thank you.

322
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:03.030
You didn't need to do this.

323
00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:04.860
It's nothing.

324
00:23:04.867 --> 00:23:07.260
It's part of employee welfare.

325
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:09.500
Then at least let me pay.

326
00:23:09.505 --> 00:23:12.200
If you must, you can just give me a cup of tea.

327
00:23:12.207 --> 00:23:14.370
Oh, my. I'm sorry. Take a seat.

328
00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:16.110
No, it's fine.

329
00:23:16.111 --> 00:23:18.650
You don't need to bring me anything. But take a seat.

330
00:23:20.115 --> 00:23:21.490
All right.

331
00:23:28.457 --> 00:23:29.930
Take a look at this.

332
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.590
Next month, buyers from Nagoya will be visiting.

333
00:23:34.596 --> 00:23:36.030
This is their schedule.

334
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:39.500
They said they wanted to visit the ancient palaces, so I put it there.

335
00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:41.270
I'd like you to help me.

336
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.770
Me?

337
00:23:42.771 --> 00:23:45.200
You wanted to be a city curator.

338
00:23:45.207 --> 00:23:47.580
And you've been studying.

339
00:23:47.643 --> 00:23:50.240
You'd be the best choice we have.

340
00:23:50.245 --> 00:23:51.940
You can fulfill your dream as you work.

341
00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:53.850
Oh, my.

342
00:23:53.882 --> 00:23:55.450
Are you moved?

343
00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:07.560
They say no one should dare try to stop domestic disputes,

344
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.400
but I don't get why they're getting worse.

345
00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:17.410
Should I intervene and solve everything?

346
00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:41.400
What time is it?

347
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.330
You can sleep for 20 more minutes.

348
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.340
I don't want to go to work.

349
00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:51.480
That's great. Just skip work and play with me.

350
00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:54.710
Are you going to earn money for me then?

351
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.110
Of course.

352
00:24:57.246 --> 00:25:01.150
You're supposed to be moved and kiss me 100 times.

353
00:25:04.453 --> 00:25:06.720
My mouth was closed all night long.

354
00:25:06.822 --> 00:25:08.390
Do you really want me to kiss you?

355
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:10.660
No. I'm upset now.

356
00:25:10.893 --> 00:25:12.460
All right.

357
00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:15.300
But you need to block your nose.

358
00:25:15.397 --> 00:25:17.370
All right. Here.

359
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:24.100
Mom, Dad! Is today a special day?

360
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:26.910
Why are there presents in my room?

361
00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:28.810
What do you think?

362
00:25:28.977 --> 00:25:32.320
What do you think? Shall we go to your room together?

363
00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:35.420
Gosh, you're adorable.

364
00:25:36.752 --> 00:25:38.490
Gosh.

365
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.720
It seems like I'd have to work really hard...

366
00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:45.830
until my legs swell up today.

367
00:25:46.662 --> 00:25:49.590
They say you're an idiot if you hold back three times.

368
00:25:49.598 --> 00:25:52.700
I must be an idiot. Gosh.

369
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.240
Ms. Choi,

370
00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:58.000
why are you talking to yourself so early in the morning?

371
00:25:58.006 --> 00:26:00.440
And you're pouting. What's the matter?

372
00:26:00.742 --> 00:26:03.710
Ma'am, I know you're rich,

373
00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:05.540
but you have no sense.

374
00:26:05.547 --> 00:26:08.510
Sense? Feel?

375
00:26:08.517 --> 00:26:10.250
Yes.

376
00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:12.720
You told me to prepare Han Gyul's birthday meal,

377
00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:15.690
but people would mistake this for one's 60th birthday.

378
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:19.200
No one holds birthday parties at home these days.

379
00:26:19.361 --> 00:26:21.260
People borrow a party room...

380
00:26:21.263 --> 00:26:23.730
and hire a party planner to plan a party for them.

381
00:26:24.466 --> 00:26:29.340
This isn't the Cheongdam-dong style. It's the Beolgyo style.

382
00:26:31.907 --> 00:26:34.610
What's wrong?

383
00:26:35.277 --> 00:26:38.920
Did I make another mistake?

384
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:42.350
Did I tell you that I used to be an assistant for sewers...

385
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:47.450
at a sewing factory when I was young?

386
00:26:47.456 --> 00:26:51.500
Yes, why?

387
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.190
I still have a sewing machine in the basement storage.

388
00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:59.240
I could take that out and sew your mouth up.

389
00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:01.940
So be quiet...

390
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.470
and do your job.

391
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.240
(A Comfortable and Precious Home)

392
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.850
It's a storybook which I don't like.

393
00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:15.850
It's my present to you. You hurt my feelings by saying that.

394
00:27:18.687 --> 00:27:22.020
Seeing that she doesn't like books,

395
00:27:22.024 --> 00:27:24.660
she must take after her mom, not her dad.

396
00:27:25.794 --> 00:27:28.030
Of course, she's my daughter.

397
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.400
I completely know Han Gyul's taste.

398
00:27:31.466 --> 00:27:33.500
Han Gyul, close your eyes.

399
00:27:39.141 --> 00:27:40.840
Ta-da.

400
00:27:42.711 --> 00:27:46.050
- Do you like it? - Yes, you're the best.

401
00:27:46.648 --> 00:27:49.490
Here, it's pretty.

402
00:27:51.153 --> 00:27:55.360
Dr. Lee, you're going to have to earn a lot of money.

403
00:27:55.524 --> 00:27:59.900
It looks like she takes after her mom and likes luxury goods.

404
00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:01.460
I guess so.

405
00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:04.630
I'll have to earn a lot to serve three ladies who like luxury goods.

406
00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:07.900
Grandma, don't you have a present for me?

407
00:28:07.969 --> 00:28:09.300
Of course, I have one.

408
00:28:09.304 --> 00:28:11.770
I prepared and paid everything...

409
00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:14.740
to send you to America...

410
00:28:14.743 --> 00:28:17.840
to study English.

411
00:28:17.846 --> 00:28:20.940
Go to America during summer break...

412
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:24.860
and study English hard like me.

413
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.420
Oh, my goodness.

414
00:28:27.522 --> 00:28:31.420
New York. You're going to New York.

415
00:28:31.426 --> 00:28:35.130
You're going to travel first class on a plane to go there.

416
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.430
Are you happy?

417
00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:42.970
Are we almost at Han Gyul's house?

418
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.340
We're almost there.

419
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.640
His dad must be at work, right?

420
00:28:48.643 --> 00:28:50.950
Of course. He goes to work early in the morning.

421
00:29:01.623 --> 00:29:05.120
I can't believe that Han Gyul is pretty rich.

422
00:29:05.127 --> 00:29:07.690
Han Gyul's house is really nice.

423
00:29:07.696 --> 00:29:10.530
That's right. It's not an apartment, and there's a yard.

424
00:29:10.532 --> 00:29:12.800
Don't embarrass me.

425
00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:14.670
My family is richer.

426
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.340
We live in an apartment in Samseong-dong.

427
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:20.100
You should greet adults if you see them first.

428
00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:21.910
- Do you understand? - Yes.

429
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.080
Have a nice day.

430
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.950
It's going to be hard for you today.

431
00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:31.920
The kids are coming to visit for the party.

432
00:29:32.154 --> 00:29:34.280
Yes, I'm really looking forward.

433
00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:36.230
It's the first birthday party we prepared for her.

434
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:40.160
The kids are already here.

435
00:29:40.562 --> 00:29:41.830
Kids?

436
00:29:43.732 --> 00:29:44.760
Welcome.

437
00:29:44.766 --> 00:29:46.200
Are you Han Gyul's friends?

438
00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:48.340
- Yes, hello. - Yes, hello.

439
00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:51.140
- Have fun. - Okay.

440
00:29:52.474 --> 00:29:53.980
- I'll be back. - Okay.

441
00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:02.980
Let's have fun.

442
00:30:02.984 --> 00:30:04.320
- Okay. - Okay.

443
00:30:04.653 --> 00:30:06.720
- Who is Do Yoon? - It's me.

444
00:30:07.022 --> 00:30:08.860
You're so handsome.

445
00:30:14.763 --> 00:30:17.470
- I think we should start serving. - Okay.

446
00:30:20.602 --> 00:30:22.110
Are you Han Gyul's mother?

447
00:30:22.704 --> 00:30:25.010
- Yes? - Do you remember me?

448
00:30:27.709 --> 00:30:29.940
You work at the kid's cafe, right?

449
00:30:29.945 --> 00:30:33.220
Yes, my boss sent this.

450
00:30:36.685 --> 00:30:38.960
She didn't have to do this.

451
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:41.890
You went through a lot of trouble to bring the kids.

452
00:30:42.157 --> 00:30:44.650
It's okay. Can I help you with something?

453
00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:45.760
It's okay.

454
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.870
Everything is already done. Sit and eat something before you go.

455
00:30:49.397 --> 00:30:50.670
Thank you.

456
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.670
Did Se Ra's mom say...

457
00:30:55.871 --> 00:30:58.240
anything about me?

458
00:31:00.408 --> 00:31:03.880
Yes, she praised you saying that you are pretty and stylish.

459
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.480
Really?

460
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:10.190
But she said that there was something strange.

461
00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:13.360
She said that Han Gyul didn't have any records of...

462
00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:15.160
receiving an education from elsewhere.

463
00:31:16.725 --> 00:31:19.360
Really?

464
00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:22.670
The mothers are really powerful in this neighborhood.

465
00:31:22.764 --> 00:31:24.730
They even nitpick over postnatal care centers...

466
00:31:24.733 --> 00:31:28.070
and ostracize someone if they're even a little different from them.

467
00:31:30.405 --> 00:31:33.040
What are you talking about?

468
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.880
Han Gyul isn't different.

469
00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.850
Ms. Ha went through a lot of trouble for 10 months to have her.

470
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.920
Don't let them say that.

471
00:31:42.017 --> 00:31:44.690
Really? Is that so?

472
00:31:59.234 --> 00:32:02.410
I'm scared that Han Gyul's birth mother might appear.

473
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.640
Isn't it time for her to be released from prison?

474
00:32:18.153 --> 00:32:21.060
Is this Cheongju Women's Penitentiary? I have a question.

475
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.790
Can you tell me the release date of an inmate?

476
00:32:25.126 --> 00:32:26.400
I'm sorry.

477
00:32:26.428 --> 00:32:29.530
We only report the release date to the inmate.

478
00:32:31.232 --> 00:32:32.500
Okay.

479
00:32:54.022 --> 00:32:57.390
Ms. Ha went through a lot of trouble for 10 months to have her.

480
00:32:57.492 --> 00:32:59.000
What are you talking about?

481
00:33:00.462 --> 00:33:03.470
This is so funny. You look so happy.

482
00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:07.400
My sister is crying in a fiery fit.

483
00:33:24.052 --> 00:33:31.560
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

484
00:33:31.593 --> 00:33:35.970
- Happy birthday dear Han Gyul - Happy birthday dear Han Gyul

485
00:33:36.031 --> 00:33:40.200
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

486
00:33:43.471 --> 00:33:44.930
- Happy birthday Han Gyul. - Happy birthday.

487
00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:48.210
It's my birthday today.

488
00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:50.510
Thank you for coming.

489
00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:54.010
Please don't fight...

490
00:33:54.015 --> 00:33:57.420
but have fun and be friendly to one another.

491
00:33:57.652 --> 00:33:59.260
- Okay. - Okay.

492
00:34:01.022 --> 00:34:02.330
Ms. Ha.

493
00:34:03.158 --> 00:34:05.500
Where did you buy Han Gyul's dress?

494
00:34:05.593 --> 00:34:06.960
She looks like a princess.

495
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:08.760
That's right. She's so pretty.

496
00:34:08.763 --> 00:34:10.730
Really? Do you like it?

497
00:34:10.732 --> 00:34:12.500
Yes, it's really pretty.

498
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:15.670
Han Gyul is the prettiest from our preschool.

499
00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:22.810
No, you're more good looking than I am.

500
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:24.970
Oh, my.

501
00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:28.110
They're young, but they're already flirting.

502
00:34:28.116 --> 00:34:30.350
It's so nice.

503
00:34:31.886 --> 00:34:34.820
Eat a lot of delicious food and have fun, okay?

504
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:36.190
- Yes. - Yes.

505
00:34:36.191 --> 00:34:38.030
- Okay. - Oh, my.

506
00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:48.470
Lee Han Gyul, I need to talk to you for a moment.

507
00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.680
What is this?

508
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:01.720
They're my new cards.

509
00:35:02.383 --> 00:35:05.490
Just take this.

510
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.130
But Kim Do Yoon is mine.

511
00:35:18.766 --> 00:35:23.170
1, 2, 3.

512
00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:25.010
There are only three cards.

513
00:35:25.173 --> 00:35:28.780
Kim Se Ra, this isn't enough.

514
00:35:28.843 --> 00:35:30.650
I'll give them back to you.

515
00:35:30.712 --> 00:35:32.550
Take your words back.

516
00:35:42.323 --> 00:35:46.130
Oh Han Gyul. No, you're Lee Han Gyul now.

517
00:35:46.995 --> 00:35:50.330
If you tell your mom that you saw me,

518
00:35:50.498 --> 00:35:52.000
I'm going to take you away again.

519
00:35:52.267 --> 00:35:53.600
Do you understand?

520
00:36:11.886 --> 00:36:15.990
Yes, this person came out from the ward on the day of the accident.

521
00:36:19.093 --> 00:36:20.400
Is that so?

522
00:36:20.995 --> 00:36:22.730
The hard drive is damaged?

523
00:36:24.365 --> 00:36:25.840
Okay.

524
00:36:27.902 --> 00:36:29.910
Couldn't they restore the security footage?

525
00:36:30.305 --> 00:36:33.940
I thought they could, but the hard drive is severely damaged.

526
00:36:34.075 --> 00:36:37.710
Then we have no other way but to ask Mr. Kim directly about...

527
00:36:38.446 --> 00:36:41.980
why he came to hospital last night to meet Director Park and Ae Ri...

528
00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:45.550
and also who ordered him to pull off the respirator.

529
00:36:45.553 --> 00:36:49.290
We don't have enough evidence to doubt Director Park.

530
00:36:50.225 --> 00:36:52.560
He went to visit Joo Ae Ri every day.

531
00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:54.490
They might have met accidentally.

532
00:36:54.495 --> 00:36:56.730
Let's look for Mr. Kim first.

533
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.240
Manager Jung. Manager Jung.

534
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.970
I've asked the HR for Mr. Kim's address.

535
00:37:04.973 --> 00:37:07.040
They recently had the order from above...

536
00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:09.570
and deleted all data related to Mr. Kim.

537
00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:11.810
What? Who did?

538
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.440
They won't tell us.

539
00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:15.140
It's certain...

540
00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:17.150
that there's an accomplice in the company.

541
00:37:17.652 --> 00:37:19.920
I need to talk to Dad at home.

542
00:37:20.021 --> 00:37:23.690
I might get Mr. Kim's address from Choi Sun Young.

543
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:26.800
Hurry up. I'll look into it in the company.

544
00:37:48.116 --> 00:37:51.150
One of the nurses said she saw you.

545
00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:55.020
It's driving me crazy.

546
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.180
How's the board of directors going?

547
00:38:21.182 --> 00:38:24.380
Manager Jung's going to be appointed as an executive today.

548
00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:26.220
All the members will show up.

549
00:38:26.421 --> 00:38:29.420
It's a meaningful day for both myself and the company.

550
00:38:29.424 --> 00:38:31.220
Prepare it according to the plan.

551
00:38:31.225 --> 00:38:32.530
Yes, sir.

552
00:38:37.532 --> 00:38:38.840
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:39.534 --> 00:38:41.970
How's the new store opening going?

554
00:38:42.136 --> 00:38:44.900
That is also getting ready according to the plan.

555
00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:48.180
We must increase the domestic sales by all means.

556
00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:51.170
Beijing branch is struggling due to the effect of THAAD.

557
00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:53.010
The domestic sales must endure...

558
00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:54.580
in order to go public it this year.

559
00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:56.880
You know what happens...

560
00:38:56.884 --> 00:38:59.220
if we fail to go public, right?

561
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.590
Don't worry. We're getting more franchises,

562
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.430
and there will be no problem once the new store opens.

563
00:39:10.965 --> 00:39:13.100
Answer it. It seems urgent.

564
00:39:13.634 --> 00:39:15.070
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.610
Why do you keep calling me?

566
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:29.950
What is your plan?

567
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:32.490
Jung Tae Yang's prying me.

568
00:39:32.653 --> 00:39:34.590
Are you going to let him?

569
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.430
Are you...

570
00:39:38.593 --> 00:39:40.900
planning to use me and abandon me?

571
00:39:41.095 --> 00:39:42.970
Calm down and hang up.

572
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:45.400
I'll call you later.

573
00:39:53.908 --> 00:39:55.950
You've done a good job.

574
00:39:56.244 --> 00:39:58.980
You've endured the third surgery.

575
00:39:59.614 --> 00:40:03.150
The tissues could've been more damaged due to the fire,

576
00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:04.990
but you avoided it.

577
00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.420
What's the first thing you want to do when you leave?

578
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.050
I have so many things to do.

579
00:40:12.059 --> 00:40:14.400
You can do that from now on.

580
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.900
Are you ready?

581
00:40:42.156 --> 00:40:43.930
You're very lucky.

582
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:05.450
You can go home today.

583
00:41:18.092 --> 00:41:19.560
(Director Park)

584
00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:21.860
Mr. Kim's causing problems.

585
00:41:21.863 --> 00:41:23.400
What do you want me to do?

586
00:41:24.098 --> 00:41:27.240
Set up a meeting tonight.

587
00:41:36.811 --> 00:41:38.610
Did you say Mr. Kim?

588
00:41:38.613 --> 00:41:40.080
We have a witness.

589
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:42.950
She saw him leaving the room...

590
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:44.750
once the respirator alarm went off.

591
00:41:46.053 --> 00:41:48.780
Your dad and I doubted Director Park.

592
00:41:48.789 --> 00:41:50.920
He supported Joo Ae Ri on everything...

593
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:52.930
and alienated Lee Ru Ri.

594
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.930
He's suspicious too.

595
00:41:54.996 --> 00:41:58.970
Mr. Kim visited the room where Joo Ae Ri and Director Park were.

596
00:41:59.634 --> 00:42:02.870
Does that mean three of them planned it?

597
00:42:03.905 --> 00:42:06.540
Tae Yang. How can I be a help?

598
00:42:06.974 --> 00:42:10.150
Mr. Kim has the key to everything, but we don't know where he is.

599
00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:14.650
Can you call Choi Sun Young and find out?

600
00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:17.550
What if Choi Sun Young is behind all this?

601
00:42:17.552 --> 00:42:20.120
Mr. Kim was her right arm.

602
00:42:20.521 --> 00:42:22.530
This will not be the end.

603
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.890
I'm on the way to Japan.

604
00:42:25.092 --> 00:42:26.990
Once I find right investors,

605
00:42:26.994 --> 00:42:30.970
I'm going to return all the humiliation Kevin gave me.

606
00:42:31.499 --> 00:42:34.840
I have an idea. Just bear it until then.

607
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.770
Right. She told me she'll come back.

608
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.280
Do you think Joo Ae Ri...

609
00:42:42.843 --> 00:42:45.070
and Choi Sun Young are connected?

610
00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:47.180
Ask for Mr. Kim's address.

611
00:42:47.515 --> 00:42:48.820
Okay.

612
00:42:56.591 --> 00:43:00.530
I'm sorry, but please check the personal record one more time.

613
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:03.260
His name is Kim Dong Il.

614
00:43:03.264 --> 00:43:06.600
He worked as Chief Choi's assistant until three months ago.

615
00:43:07.201 --> 00:43:09.000
Yes. Please.

616
00:43:10.571 --> 00:43:11.840
Ru Ri.

617
00:43:12.907 --> 00:43:14.540
I found it.

618
00:43:16.944 --> 00:43:19.710
I'm the company source.

619
00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:22.550
You know Cha Eun Kyung from the chairman's secretary office?

620
00:43:23.618 --> 00:43:27.420
She dated Mr. Kim for a while.

621
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:30.220
Is that true, Eun Kyung?

622
00:43:30.224 --> 00:43:34.420
Yes. He called me first, so we went on a date a few times.

623
00:43:34.428 --> 00:43:36.830
But he kept asking me about Chairman Kevin.

624
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:39.500
He seemed strange, so I ended it.

625
00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:42.130
Do you know where he lives?

626
00:43:42.136 --> 00:43:43.970
It says his phone number doesn't exist.

627
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:46.180
I went to his house once.

628
00:43:46.407 --> 00:43:48.540
He lives in a studio in Hapjeong-dong.

629
00:43:50.444 --> 00:43:52.440
Thank you so much, Eun Kyung.

630
00:43:52.446 --> 00:43:54.210
I'll never forget what you've done for me.

631
00:43:54.215 --> 00:43:55.380
Move aside.

632
00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:58.250
Ru Ri. You should never forget me either.

633
00:43:58.786 --> 00:44:01.820
Of course, Myung Rang. Good job. Well done.

634
00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:03.550
I know, right? Thank you.

635
00:44:03.557 --> 00:44:04.990
Good job.

636
00:44:09.096 --> 00:44:10.730
Gosh.

637
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.510
Yes.

638
00:44:20.641 --> 00:44:22.040
Tonight.

639
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.050
At 9pm.

640
00:44:25.379 --> 00:44:27.510
I'll text you the place.

641
00:44:27.515 --> 00:44:28.820
You know...

642
00:44:29.383 --> 00:44:32.760
if anything goes wrong, I have a plan too.

643
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:43.430
Mi Rae apartment in Hapjeong-dong?

644
00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:46.460
Yes. What did Choi Sun Young say?

645
00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:47.900
Dad talked to her on the phone,

646
00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:50.240
but she hasn't talked to Mr. Kim for a long time.

647
00:44:51.038 --> 00:44:53.340
I think he does live in Hapjeong-dong though.

648
00:44:53.474 --> 00:44:55.170
That's what she said too.

649
00:44:55.176 --> 00:44:57.840
But do you think we can trust her?

650
00:44:57.845 --> 00:45:01.510
She's suspicious as well since Mr. Kim and Ae Ri are connected.

651
00:45:01.515 --> 00:45:02.920
Of course.

652
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.010
When she left Korea,

653
00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:08.760
she said she'll return and pay for what she had gone through.

654
00:45:10.491 --> 00:45:12.690
Is Choi Sun Young really behind all this?

655
00:45:12.693 --> 00:45:16.170
We'll find out when we find Mr. Kim.

656
00:45:18.632 --> 00:45:20.740
This is so horrible.

657
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:50.970
Follow him.

658
00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:18.130
How did it go?

659
00:46:18.325 --> 00:46:20.160
I'm on the way to meet him.

660
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:21.960
Can you take care of it?

661
00:46:22.096 --> 00:46:25.030
Don't worry. I'll see you when I'm finished.

662
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:27.500
We should congratulate you on leaving the hospital.

663
00:46:33.174 --> 00:46:35.950
Turn left. Turn left. Turn left!

664
00:46:44.552 --> 00:46:45.850
Are you all right?

665
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.360
I'm all right. Let's follow him.

666
00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.170
I think he went that way.

667
00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:16.750
Come to the redevelopment area in Mogeum-dong.

668
00:47:37.872 --> 00:47:39.270
What is your plan?

669
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.540
Jung Tae Yang's prying me. What are you going to do for me?

670
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.450
You're not as bold as I thought.

671
00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:48.210
Weren't you ready for this when you came to me?

672
00:47:48.215 --> 00:47:49.820
Director Park!

673
00:47:54.021 --> 00:47:55.320
Here.

674
00:47:59.693 --> 00:48:01.800
Stay in Clark, Philippines for a while.

675
00:48:02.029 --> 00:48:03.690
I'll pay everything.

676
00:48:03.697 --> 00:48:06.740
You should go take a rest, and I'll call you.

677
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.550
Do you think I'm an idiot?

678
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:24.350
Do you think I don't know what you're doing?

679
00:48:24.451 --> 00:48:27.990
Now that I'm useless, you're going to leave me out like this?

680
00:48:29.723 --> 00:48:31.630
That's why I prepared something.

681
00:48:31.892 --> 00:48:33.200
You prepared something?

682
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.600
It's over.

683
00:48:41.702 --> 00:48:44.270
Let Dad die in peace now.

684
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.610
Do you understand now?

685
00:48:47.808 --> 00:48:50.510
Everything you said is recorded here.

686
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:53.880
What would Jung Tae Yang do if he finds out?

687
00:49:03.557 --> 00:49:06.260
Hello? Tae Yang?

688
00:49:08.762 --> 00:49:10.030
What are you doing?

689
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.330
Give it to me.

690
00:49:20.174 --> 00:49:22.910
Give it back. Give it to me. Let it go!

691
00:49:23.344 --> 00:49:24.510
Give it back.

692
00:49:24.511 --> 00:49:25.980
Stop it, scum.

693
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.920
Let go! Let go!

694
00:49:28.282 --> 00:49:29.590
Let it go!

695
00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:19.970
It's been a while.

696
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.120
Let's go. It's dangerous out here.

697
00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:46.700
It's Mr. Kim's car.

698
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.050
Mr. Kim.

699
00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:10.590
Mr. Kim!

700
00:51:12.886 --> 00:51:15.760
I feel cold. Please...

701
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.650
Why did you wake up so early?

702
00:51:43.784 --> 00:51:45.350
I needed to see something.

703
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.130
I'm trying to track Ha Eun Jo, but it's not easy.

704
00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.720
It's been over 40 years.

705
00:51:55.729 --> 00:51:57.570
What are you looking at?

706
00:51:58.098 --> 00:52:00.630
I started from the station where he got lost...

707
00:52:00.634 --> 00:52:02.870
and searched around all the orphanages near the area.

708
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:05.010
But there weren't any records.

709
00:52:07.074 --> 00:52:08.510
What should we do now?

710
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:11.780
The last train at the station was headed to Seoul.

711
00:52:12.346 --> 00:52:14.680
Maybe he got on that train.

712
00:52:15.249 --> 00:52:17.750
So I'll try again by looking into orphanages in Seoul.

713
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.760
You must be tired from all this.

714
00:52:23.924 --> 00:52:26.660
If you're so worried,

715
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:28.700
please get up from my knees.

716
00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:30.330
My knees are about to break.

717
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:32.830
Gosh.

718
00:52:34.601 --> 00:52:37.570
I'm hungry. Should we eat something as an appetizer?

719
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:40.470
All right. For the first time in my life,

720
00:52:40.474 --> 00:52:43.440
I'll cook the instant soup that you like.

721
00:52:43.443 --> 00:52:44.710
All right.

722
00:52:47.014 --> 00:52:48.610
It looks all right.

723
00:52:48.615 --> 00:52:50.920
- Are you done? - Just wait a moment.

724
00:52:53.554 --> 00:52:54.820
Do you want to taste it?

725
00:52:55.289 --> 00:52:56.820
You should taste it first.

726
00:52:56.823 --> 00:53:00.190
You've cooked for the first time. You should taste it first.

727
00:53:00.194 --> 00:53:02.460
No, you should taste it.

728
00:53:03.263 --> 00:53:05.200
Are you making me taste it because it might taste awful?

729
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.070
All right.

730
00:53:12.906 --> 00:53:14.880
How does it taste? Is it all right?

731
00:53:16.076 --> 00:53:18.010
It's really good.

732
00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:19.710
- Really? - Yes.

733
00:53:19.713 --> 00:53:21.420
Gosh, I'm good.

734
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:25.050
Gosh, it's so salty!

735
00:53:26.053 --> 00:53:27.360
Hey!

736
00:53:31.825 --> 00:53:33.160
Gosh.

737
00:53:34.828 --> 00:53:37.070
I'm so happy.

738
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:41.100
Just like you said, I'm scared because everything's so perfect.

739
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:45.170
Mom said we shouldn't say that we're happy out loud.

740
00:53:45.172 --> 00:53:47.680
She says the sky will get jealous and take everything away.

741
00:53:47.841 --> 00:53:50.050
Really? All right.

742
00:53:51.845 --> 00:53:55.380
Ha Yeon Ju, I can't bear to be your husband anymore.

743
00:53:55.616 --> 00:53:58.490
How can you tell me to make a meal this early?

744
00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:00.820
You're such a bad wife.

745
00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:04.590
You're worse.

746
00:54:04.591 --> 00:54:08.800
I thought it'd be better now that we got remarried, but you're the same.

747
00:54:09.096 --> 00:54:12.390
You're handsome, but now that I get to see you every day,

748
00:54:12.399 --> 00:54:14.340
I'm sick of it.

749
00:54:14.968 --> 00:54:18.470
That's settled then. We should break up again.

750
00:54:18.472 --> 00:54:19.780
All right.

751
00:54:20.073 --> 00:54:22.280
Mom, don't fight!

752
00:54:24.411 --> 00:54:27.080
What is this nonsense?

753
00:54:27.447 --> 00:54:31.150
You just got married again. Why are you fighting again?

754
00:54:31.218 --> 00:54:34.450
They say that lovers' quarrels are soon mended,

755
00:54:34.454 --> 00:54:36.890
but you shouldn't fight like that again.

756
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:39.860
Mrs. Yang, it's cutting water with knife.

757
00:54:39.926 --> 00:54:42.960
Gosh, you stupid. I know. Shut it.

758
00:54:42.963 --> 00:54:46.200
Mrs. Yang, it's not like that. We were joking around.

759
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:49.970
Han Gyul, don't cry.

760
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:53.340
Mom and Dad were pretending to fight for fun.

761
00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.740
We were so happy that we were afraid that the sky would be jealous.

762
00:54:55.742 --> 00:54:57.450
You scum.

763
00:54:57.477 --> 00:55:01.580
Gosh, how can you even think of this nonsense?

764
00:55:01.581 --> 00:55:04.220
When are you going to grow up?

765
00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:07.320
Don't scold Dad.

766
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:09.320
You are stupid, Grandmother.

767
00:55:09.323 --> 00:55:10.790
Tae kwon!

768
00:55:11.692 --> 00:55:13.090
Gosh, it hurts.

769
00:55:13.093 --> 00:55:15.320
What is this nonsense?

770
00:55:15.329 --> 00:55:17.470
Shut your mouth.

771
00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:21.100
You're just like your dad, always joking around.

772
00:55:21.501 --> 00:55:22.900
What about Dad?

773
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:27.380
If you want to find out, you should go on a date with me.

774
00:55:52.766 --> 00:55:54.300
I heard there's a lot of fine dust today,

775
00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:56.340
so put on a mask and be careful.

776
00:56:01.742 --> 00:56:05.050
Han Gyul must have a cold. She says she doesn't want to go to preschool.

777
00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:07.280
Do you think she has a problem with her friends?

778
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.550
That can't be. She had such fun on her birthday.

779
00:56:11.151 --> 00:56:12.750
Maybe she doesn't want to study.

780
00:56:13.387 --> 00:56:15.260
She must take after you.

781
00:56:15.655 --> 00:56:18.430
If she isn't really sick, you should send her to school in the afternoon.

782
00:56:18.925 --> 00:56:20.130
All right.

783
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.590
Come home early today.

784
00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:23.630
I'll make something delicious and wait for you.

785
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:27.130
Okay, but don't cook.

786
00:56:27.134 --> 00:56:29.240
It's better when you don't cook.

787
00:56:29.269 --> 00:56:31.070
Stop it. Go now.

788
00:56:54.928 --> 00:56:57.730
This is for social justice.

789
00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:12.770
I know all about Han Gyul's birth.

790
00:57:12.779 --> 00:57:14.980
Unless you want to be humiliated in the kindergarten,

791
00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:16.650
do as I say.

792
00:57:29.763 --> 00:57:31.170
How do I do this?

793
00:57:31.498 --> 00:57:33.500
Do I just put it on?

794
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.000
Let me try.

795
00:57:35.969 --> 00:57:38.070
Oh, cold.

796
00:57:38.071 --> 00:57:42.610
I have a date today. I have to look good.

797
00:57:52.652 --> 00:57:58.030
Gosh. Why does he keep gaining on?

798
00:57:58.191 --> 00:58:01.360
I was going to have a good time with her.

799
00:58:01.361 --> 00:58:02.630
(Oh Dong Ki)

800
00:58:07.801 --> 00:58:09.500
Goodness.

801
00:58:10.637 --> 00:58:14.440
What on earth are you doing?

802
00:58:14.841 --> 00:58:18.450
What's that facial mask for? You've never done that before.

803
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.250
You come to my house often now.

804
00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:25.950
Are you here to spy on something?

805
00:58:25.952 --> 00:58:28.660
Gosh. What are you talking about?

806
00:58:28.788 --> 00:58:31.630
It was Han Gyul's birthday yesterday.

807
00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:35.090
Give it to So Won when you meet him.

808
00:58:35.095 --> 00:58:36.700
I bought clothes for her.

809
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.030
Is that why you're here?

810
00:58:39.399 --> 00:58:43.060
You're not here to check if I'm going on a date?

811
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:44.740
Oh, my goodness.

812
00:58:44.804 --> 00:58:48.900
I don't care even if you marry someone else.

813
00:58:48.909 --> 00:58:50.150
But...

814
00:58:50.677 --> 00:58:52.570
I'm just worried you'd embarrass...

815
00:58:52.579 --> 00:58:54.680
- Ru Ri when she gets married... - Don't you...

816
00:58:54.681 --> 00:58:56.380
worry about that.

817
00:58:56.383 --> 00:59:00.860
I'll go on a date secretly, so it wouldn't affect her.

818
00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:08.800
Yes. Theresa. Hi.

819
00:59:08.862 --> 00:59:12.830
I'll go pick you up at your house. Send me your address.

820
00:59:13.099 --> 00:59:15.400
Yes. Okay. I'll see you later.

821
00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:21.140
Why does she want to see me so badly?

822
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:23.040
Gosh. It's a hassle.

823
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:26.580
Don't endure it anymore

824
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.250
Don't hide your heart

825
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:33.620
Don't act like you don't know

826
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.720
- You - Gosh.

827
00:59:36.189 --> 00:59:39.960
He's gone crazy big time. He's talking nonsense.

828
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.560
What does she do...

829
00:59:42.762 --> 00:59:46.030
that she keeps meeting him?

830
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:53.880
Goodness.

831
00:59:54.474 --> 00:59:55.780
Mother.

832
00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:00.080
Oh, yes. You're here.

833
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.110
Here you are.

834
01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:02.280
Yes.

835
01:00:02.282 --> 01:00:05.220
I bought as you said. What is it for?

836
01:00:05.385 --> 01:00:08.020
Quiet. Leave it up to me.

837
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.650
By the way, is your father going out today?

838
01:00:10.657 --> 01:00:13.250
Yes. He's going to sing there.

839
01:00:13.259 --> 01:00:16.960
Yes. That's great.

840
01:00:16.963 --> 01:00:18.730
Goodness. It's nice.

841
01:00:19.132 --> 01:00:20.600
- Mrs. Yang. - Goodness.

842
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.500
When did you get here?

843
01:00:22.636 --> 01:00:25.200
Now that I'm old,

844
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.940
my butt must be twisted.

845
01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:30.510
My waist, bust, shoulders...

846
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:34.580
My whole body hurts, and I can't sleep well.

847
01:00:34.748 --> 01:00:37.350
I'm here because my son-in-law...

848
01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:40.490
said he'll buy one for me.

849
01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.920
It's a hassle to come to hospital,

850
01:00:42.922 --> 01:00:44.920
so I decided to get one for her for the New Year.

851
01:00:44.924 --> 01:00:46.490
That's a good idea.

852
01:00:46.493 --> 01:00:48.490
Check it carefully.

853
01:00:48.495 --> 01:00:52.230
You're very good at business.

854
01:00:53.466 --> 01:00:56.130
I'll recommend you a good condition.

855
01:00:56.136 --> 01:00:58.870
I can't just take it.

856
01:00:58.872 --> 01:01:02.740
My close friend owns this cafe.

857
01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:06.070
Go there for dinner tonight...

858
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.610
and enjoy the music.

859
01:01:08.615 --> 01:01:11.750
You can go relieve your stress tonight.

860
01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:24.230
Shin Mo. Open up.

861
01:01:24.731 --> 01:01:26.300
What? Oh...

862
01:01:27.033 --> 01:01:30.740
What are you doing? You're embarrassing my hand.

863
01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:33.640
- Open up. - Okay.

864
01:01:40.714 --> 01:01:43.650
You eat like a real man.

865
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.490
What? Real man?

866
01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:49.920
When men are over 50, there are only two types.

867
01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:52.860
They either become a woman or a man.

868
01:01:52.992 --> 01:01:56.130
You're forever the latter.

869
01:01:56.696 --> 01:01:59.390
Stop flattering.

870
01:01:59.399 --> 01:02:02.900
You flatter me so much that if you stop, I'll die.

871
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:08.380
You're so funny, Shin Mo.

872
01:02:10.744 --> 01:02:14.320
By the way, Theresa.

873
01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:20.020
I'm not sure if it's okay for me to date you.

874
01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.530
Of course, I like spending time with you,

875
01:02:24.924 --> 01:02:28.200
but I thought your husband wouldn't like it.

876
01:02:29.729 --> 01:02:32.470
You don't need to worry about it.

877
01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:35.240
Actually...

878
01:02:36.536 --> 01:02:38.840
I got a divorce five years ago.

879
01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:42.610
What? Why?

880
01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.650
We had many problems since the beginning of the marriage.

881
01:02:46.112 --> 01:02:49.580
He had a lot of money, so he did a leasing service.

882
01:02:49.649 --> 01:02:51.450
He had nothing to do...

883
01:02:51.551 --> 01:02:53.780
so that he frequently went to Gangwon province.

884
01:02:53.787 --> 01:02:58.360
You mean Gangwon Land Casino?

885
01:02:59.092 --> 01:03:03.430
Yes. He liked chips more than me.

886
01:03:04.597 --> 01:03:06.390
Did you live alone until now?

887
01:03:06.399 --> 01:03:08.740
Why didn't you meet someone better?

888
01:03:09.169 --> 01:03:12.630
I did. I had a relationship until recently.

889
01:03:12.639 --> 01:03:15.740
I see. What kind of man was he?

890
01:03:15.742 --> 01:03:17.710
A physiatrist.

891
01:03:19.445 --> 01:03:22.650
Drink this. It's dandelion tea. It's good for your stomach.

892
01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:25.280
If you keep breaking my warnings,

893
01:03:25.285 --> 01:03:27.360
I'm going to seduce you.

894
01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:31.920
Stop saying that.

895
01:03:31.925 --> 01:03:34.360
Date someone nice and marry her.

896
01:03:34.828 --> 01:03:37.630
I was actually forced...

897
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:39.290
to date someone last year.

898
01:03:39.299 --> 01:03:43.470
Goodness. Really? What kind of woman was she?

899
01:03:44.137 --> 01:03:46.400
She got a divorce five years ago.

900
01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.470
She was tall and had big eyes.

901
01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:50.950
She had long legs. She was a divorced woman.

902
01:03:51.945 --> 01:03:54.880
She must've been very beautiful.

903
01:03:55.181 --> 01:03:57.820
Yes, she was.

904
01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:00.920
She sometimes sang for hobby.

905
01:04:01.321 --> 01:04:03.480
That was very attractive.

906
01:04:03.489 --> 01:04:05.990
He was handsome and well mannered.

907
01:04:05.992 --> 01:04:08.860
He was gentle and had a lot of money.

908
01:04:10.363 --> 01:04:14.400
Really? He must've been a very good man.

909
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:18.070
He knew how to love a woman.

910
01:04:18.805 --> 01:04:21.170
But the thing is...

911
01:04:21.174 --> 01:04:24.340
he bought me a car a month after we met.

912
01:04:24.344 --> 01:04:26.370
What? A car?

913
01:04:26.379 --> 01:04:30.550
Is it popular for men these days to buy a car for women?

914
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:34.220
Shin Mo. Why would you get upset?

915
01:04:38.224 --> 01:04:39.490
But...

916
01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.800
wasn't she the one for you?

917
01:04:43.363 --> 01:04:45.230
Why are you so curious?

918
01:04:45.265 --> 01:04:47.840
Are you finally getting interested in me?

919
01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:53.610
No. She sounds like a nice woman. I wonder why you broke up.

920
01:04:54.173 --> 01:04:57.610
He has more than enough just by hearing from you.

921
01:04:57.677 --> 01:04:59.510
Why didn't you marry him?

922
01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:02.680
Are you upset because I'm talking about another man?

923
01:05:02.682 --> 01:05:05.950
What? Why would I be upset?

924
01:05:05.952 --> 01:05:08.920
I want you to be happy.

925
01:05:09.422 --> 01:05:11.530
Why did you break up?

926
01:05:12.959 --> 01:05:16.730
Well. I feel bad to say this about the woman I broke up.

927
01:05:17.697 --> 01:05:19.170
In short,

928
01:05:20.466 --> 01:05:22.100
she was a swindler.

929
01:05:24.304 --> 01:05:25.870
A swindler?

930
01:05:28.641 --> 01:05:30.140
Well...

931
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.920
I feel bad to say this about the man I broke up.

932
01:05:35.882 --> 01:05:37.920
He was...

933
01:05:38.217 --> 01:05:40.490
such a bad swindler.

934
01:05:41.054 --> 01:05:44.030
What? A swindler?

935
01:05:55.635 --> 01:05:58.010
(Man Who Sets the Table)

936
01:05:58.137 --> 01:06:01.670
Have you seen anyone strange in the kindergarten?

937
01:06:01.674 --> 01:06:03.600
No. I haven't.

938
01:06:03.609 --> 01:06:06.110
I've erased anything that could become evidence.

939
01:06:06.112 --> 01:06:08.780
Then we just have to deal with Mr. Kim now.

940
01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:11.350
Do you want to go to Jeju Island to get some fresh air?

941
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:14.050
I wonder how four people's meeting...

942
01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.080
would go tonight.

943
01:06:16.089 --> 01:06:17.820
How dare you come here?

944
01:06:17.824 --> 01:06:19.420
I need 69,000 dollars.

945
01:06:19.425 --> 01:06:21.920
I'll leave quietly if you get me that.

946
01:06:21.928 --> 01:06:25.090
His family just came by to transfer the patient.

947
01:06:25.098 --> 01:06:27.970
What do we do now? We missed the evidence right in front of us.
