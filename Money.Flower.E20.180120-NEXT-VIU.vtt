00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.459
(Episode 20)

2
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:01.150
Did you sleep well?

3
00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:08.259
From now on,

4
00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:11.889
I don't think...

5
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.930
I can make you happier than the times we spent in New York.

6
00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.529
Despite that,

7
00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:23.100
I cannot divorce you...

8
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770
right at this very minute.

9
00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:29.109
I'm sorry, Mo Hyun.

10
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080
Then...

11
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.820
I must proceed with the divorce suit.

12
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.820
That is probably...

13
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.919
your alternative.

14
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.969
Boo Cheon, come to my room by seven.

15
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.699
We must discuss a pressing matter.

16
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.719
Boo Cheon.

17
00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:18.830
Executive Jung.

18
00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.330
In order for Boo Cheon...

19
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.129
to become the chairman of Cheong A from the vice chairman,

20
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.800
it may take 3 to 5 years.

21
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.569
Under the premise...

22
00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.240
that there's no competition.

23
00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.150
This explains how to make Cheong A Bio into a holding company...

24
00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.490
and legally acquire affiliated companies under Cheong A.

25
00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.760
Make Cheong A Bio into a holding company?

26
00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.629
When Cheong A Bio becomes the holding company,

27
00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.629
Boo Cheon will be the chairman of Cheong A Bio...

28
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.700
and have the complete control over Cheong A Group.

29
00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.270
That's my plan.

30
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.240
How long does it take to make...

31
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.240
Cheong A Bio into a holding company?

32
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.110
I only need two months.

33
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.680
Boo Cheon...

34
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.520
can become...

35
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.150
the head of Cheong A Group within two months?

36
00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:24.990
- Pil Joo. - I'm aware...

37
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.960
that it won't be easy.

38
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.159
The Blue House, National Assembly, Financial Services Commission,

39
00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:31.999
Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy,

40
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.800
and Ministry of Health and Welfare in charge of national pension...

41
00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.900
will try to interfere.

42
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.069
However,

43
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.080
I will...

44
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.379
make this happen, Executive Jung.

45
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.349
Okay.

46
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.789
Pil Joo, you put your mind to it.

47
00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.860
I'm sure you'll make that happen.

48
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.319
But...

49
00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.499
if there was a way to make him the chairman over short period of time,

50
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.430
why didn't you tell me sooner?

51
00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.270
I have been waiting for President Jang Seong Man...

52
00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.439
to take a step back.

53
00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.809
His uncle would probably...

54
00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.010
want to make Cheong A Trading the holding company...

55
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.650
because he has a lot of shares in Cheong A Trading.

56
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.150
So you've been keeping this a secret.

57
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.450
Boo Cheon.

58
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.359
I can go to New York when I finish...

59
00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.159
this project, right?

60
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.400
You were going to transfer him to New York?

61
00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.400
You don't have to go now.

62
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.870
You have an important project.

63
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.010
Then what I need to do is...

64
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.810
announcing my intention that I am going to...

65
00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.950
make Cheong A Bio the holding company as the vice chairman, right?

66
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.919
Yes.

67
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.250
I'll take care of everything else.

68
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.700
All right.

69
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.239
Let's hear what our vice chairman's suggestion is.

70
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.669
What is it you want to discuss,

71
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.969
Vice Chairman Jang?

72
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.609
Grandfather.

73
00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.279
Uncle.

74
00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.409
After disbanding Strategy Team,

75
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.380
we need another way to control our affiliated companies.

76
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.380
The best way for that...

77
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.190
is to set up a holding company.

78
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.960
Setting up a holding company would be great.

79
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.859
Without having to spend much money, we can control the whole group.

80
00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.529
Of course, that's a good plan.

81
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.169
So it brings to my next point.

82
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.799
I plan to make Cheong A Bio the holding company.

83
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.169
You must not, Boo Cheon.

84
00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.510
If we are going to set up a holding company,

85
00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:32.880
it must be Cheong A Trading, the center of Cheong A Group.

86
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.750
I agree, Grandfather. It only makes sense for Cheong A Trading,

87
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.020
the pillar of Cheong A, to become the holding company.

88
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.650
You're only saying that because your father holds a lot of shares...

89
00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:43.560
from Cheong A Trading which will be yours later on.

90
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.830
We must focus on which company will give Cheong A the most profits.

91
00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:53.370
It'd be great if the company with which we can acquire...

92
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.900
the most shares with the minimum investment...

93
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.599
becomes the holding company.

94
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.440
In that case, it'd be better to make Cheong A Bio the holding company...

95
00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.179
as the shares are undervalued.

96
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.390
Attorney Kang, tell me your opinion.

97
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.820
I advise to promote Vice Chairman Jang to the chairman of...

98
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:18.960
the holding company before the presidential inauguration.

99
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.299
Are you certain you can turn Cheong A Bio into...

100
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.370
the holding company before the new administration kicks off?

101
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.839
It's not an easy task.

102
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440
However,

103
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.669
I can deliver what's promised.

104
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.279
As many governmental divisions are involved in the process,

105
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.880
Attorney Kang is the most qualified to push forward this project...

106
00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:44.989
since he is an expert in handling governmental businesses.

107
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.200
- Vice Chairman Jang. - Yes, Grandfather.

108
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.029
For the brighter future of Cheong A,

109
00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:00.070
establishing a holding company is integral.

110
00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.239
Let's settle that Cheong A Bio will become the holding company.

111
00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:05.469
Have Attorney Kang proceed with the project.

112
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.669
Yes, sir.

113
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.739
I will.

114
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.520
- Here he is! - He's coming out.

115
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.359
The prosecution has sent a subpoena. Will you comply with it?

116
00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:28.599
I didn't receive anything. What do you mean, a subpoena?

117
00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:30.060
Do you admit to the embezzlement charge?

118
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.669
We are informed you are suspected of tax evasion as well.

119
00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:33.870
- Do you admit to the charges? - Please answer our questions!

120
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.439
- Please share a word! - Are the charges true?

121
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.610
Why do you think only Cheong A is charged of these?

122
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.579
- Do you admit to the charges? - Please make a comment.

123
00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.449
Please state your position!

124
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.529
What is that?

125
00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.970
This mail arrived just now.

126
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.299
So what is it?

127
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.270
It's a subpoena to visit the prosecutors' office...

128
00:09:10.439 --> 00:09:11.669
for an investigation.

129
00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:14.880
(Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office)

130
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.189
Relay my message to Minister Park.

131
00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:31.429
Okay.

132
00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:35.659
I see. I will call you again.

133
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.640
It was a junior alumnus in the Minister of Justice.

134
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:43.270
The minister...

135
00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:47.709
won't be able to talk to you for the time being.

136
00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:49.279
Why not?

137
00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:52.279
Well, to put it simply, it's because...

138
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.819
you're from Cheong A.

139
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.319
According to my alumnus,

140
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.559
someone anonymously provided the prosecution...

141
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.459
with part of the evidence...

142
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.329
which shows that you violated the law...

143
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.230
on Special Economic Crimes such as embezzlement,

144
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.360
concealing the profits, and evasion of taxes.

145
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.799
With the information received,

146
00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.600
they are conducting an investigation.

147
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.740
It's my understanding that they subpoenaed you...

148
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:19.970
as it cannot be disregarded.

149
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.010
Sir, I believe this is...

150
00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.250
Attorney Kang's doing.

151
00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:29.880
Don't you think he may use the rest of the information?

152
00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:34.620
Attorney Kang is such a lowlife. What a scumbag.

153
00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:37.020
Why is he being so disagreeable?

154
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.630
The first priority is handling the subpoena.

155
00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:44.630
When you go to prosecutors' office, press is one thing to worry about.

156
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.340
But if your case is assigned to a team of prosecutors whose goal is...

157
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.900
taking down influential figures,

158
00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.169
it will be a serious problem.

159
00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:30.779
What are you doing?

160
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.059
The person you have reached is not available.

161
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.590
(Yong Goo)

162
00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:50.730
The person you have reached is not available.

163
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.409
(Jang Kook Hwan)

164
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.929
(Repair)

165
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.490
Yong Goo. Yong Goo.

166
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.900
(Jang Kook Hwan)

167
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.340
What a scumbag.

168
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.980
He's been collecting dirt on me for all these years?

169
00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:16.079
What is this?

170
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.850
There were some files on Attorney Kang himself.

171
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.189
I thought this might come in handy...

172
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.490
when you want to rein over Attorney Kang.

173
00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:47.110
(Attorney Kang Pil Joo)

174
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.990
Tell him that I have about...

175
00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.250
100 backup files on what he took from me,

176
00:13:54.789 --> 00:13:55.789
Mr. Woo.

177
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.270
Why are you and the chairman having this war?

178
00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:50.209
Didn't the chairman tell you the cause of this war?

179
00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:52.880
He only said he is trying to teach you a lesson.

180
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.419
- My reason is the same. - What?

181
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.789
The chairman tends to...

182
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:07.659
never change his mind once he makes his decision.

183
00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:10.029
I'm trying to change that about him.

184
00:15:12.029 --> 00:15:15.140
I'm helping him to be flexible in his thinking.

185
00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.039
Even so.

186
00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:20.470
Don't you think being investigated by the prosecution is a bit much?

187
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.939
How could you, out of all people, do this to him?

188
00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:24.140
If he doesn't...

189
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.579
listen to me again,

190
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.279
he will have no choice but serve time.

191
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.189
Attorney Kang!

195

Call Mr. Cha.

196
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.419
Mr. Cha. Honorary Chairman Jang...

197
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.490
would like to speak to you.

198
00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:12.329
Yes.

199
00:16:19.329 --> 00:16:20.770
Hey, Mr. Cha.

200
00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:23.870
I'll send over Attorney Kang.

201
00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:25.770
Why don't you arrange an interview...

202
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.880
for him to take out a loan?

203
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.980
Yes, sir.

204
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.579
I will proceed as soon as he arrives, sir.

205
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:35.650
All right.

206
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.620
Let's discuss this further when we meet.

207
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.189
Okay. Bye.

208
00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:49.000
Okay.

209
00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:51.699
What was awaiting at the end of your plan?

210
00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:55.169
It was making you serve time in prison, sir.

211
00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.240
After I take over your shares with the loan,

212
00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:03.640
I'll talk to the prosecutors.

213
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.949
I'll talk them through not to investigate you.

214
00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:11.489
Not even the Minister of Justice could do that,

215
00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.019
but can you?

216
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:14.350
It's my job...

217
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.259
to make it work.

218
00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:20.360
Are you...

219
00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:22.959
aiming to be a chairman...

220
00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:26.999
just because you're Soo Man's son?

221
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.739
Of course.

222
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.880
How dare you get...

223
00:17:35.939 --> 00:17:38.979
Cheong A's chairmanship when you're a kid out of wedlock?

224
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.650
That's nonsense.

225
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.610
Pil Joo.

226
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.390
You're...

227
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.719
suffering a lot because of me.

228
00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.459
I know.

229
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.900
You know...

230
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.999
those girls who give...

231
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.969
their bodies,

232
00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:11.540
hearts,

233
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.669
money,

234
00:19:14.439 --> 00:19:17.509
and even souls to bad boys.

235
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.080
Are you...

236
00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.179
that girl?

237
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.620
I'm worse.

238
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.719
I'm scared...

239
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:37.300
I'd devote...

240
00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.469
my life...

241
00:19:42.939 --> 00:19:44.439
for you.

242
00:19:51.249 --> 00:19:53.610
I shouldn't have mistaken you as a mother...

243
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.919
for washing my pants that I peed...

244
00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:01.790
and making me ramyeon.

245
00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:05.459
I won't make you suffer anymore.

246
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.330
I'm going to end it all.

247
00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:16.070
Soon.

248
00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:24.479
(Pulipchae)

249
00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:28.519
Two servings please.

250
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.550
Yes.

251
00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.919
You must wait...

252
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:34.249
because we cook rice...

253
00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:35.820
as you order.

254
00:20:36.019 --> 00:20:37.060
Sure.

255
00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:52.239
Good service.

256
00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:53.709
Boo Cheon.

257
00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:55.280
This isn't good enough...

258
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.709
considering what you've done for me.

259
00:20:56.709 --> 00:20:57.709
I know.

260
00:20:58.249 --> 00:20:59.709
You've become mature after going to Myanmar.

261
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.219
It's not because of Myanmar,

262
00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:04.949
but I've become a better person because you called me in.

263
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560
By the way,

264
00:21:11.989 --> 00:21:13.030
Boo Cheon.

265
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.999
About the holding company...

266
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.229
You're getting to the point now.

267
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.269
Did Kang Pil Joo suggest it to you?

268
00:21:22.169 --> 00:21:23.370
Whoever suggested it,

269
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.509
what matters is that it benefits Cheong A, doesn't it?

270
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.249
Why would he pick Cheong A Bio for a holding company specifically?

271
00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.080
Haven't you thought about it?

272
00:21:34.979 --> 00:21:37.419
Kang Pil Joo wants to make Cheong A Bio the holding company...

273
00:21:37.479 --> 00:21:40.189
even by ruining my father's plan of...

274
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.360
making Trading a holding company that committees approved.

275
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.259
Hey, Jang Yeo Cheon.

276
00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:50.999
Wake up.

277
00:21:53.199 --> 00:21:54.300
The holding company...

278
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.199
is my authority.

279
00:22:06.449 --> 00:22:09.050
Mr. Cha. How are you?

280
00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.679
I'm very good.

281
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.790
I'm just worried about you.

282
00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:15.560
Actually...

283
00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:19.189
you father asked me for a loan.

284
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.100
I'm calling you because I don't feel good about it.

285
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.759
What?

286
00:22:24.499 --> 00:22:26.070
That much?

287
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.209
Okay.

288
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.969
Thank you.

289
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.679
Mal Ran.

290
00:22:44.919 --> 00:22:47.919
Father called Mr. Cha himself...

291
00:22:49.989 --> 00:22:51.830
to lend money to Pil Joo.

292
00:22:54.759 --> 00:22:56.659
He has enough money.

293
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.870
Why would he get a loan?

294
00:23:00.699 --> 00:23:01.900
What if...

295
00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:05.669
he's getting a loan to purchase Cheong A shares?

296
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.110
If Pil Joo starts purchasing Cheong A shares...

297
00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:15.719
and becomes the biggest shareholder of Cheong A,

298
00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:19.449
that's very serious.

299
00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:24.459
He's a baby of a tiger.

300
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.530
You don't know when he'll show his claws.

301
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.900
So you must always be careful.

302
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.679
Seong Man.

303
00:23:46.209 --> 00:23:48.650
Pil Joo, Boo Cheon, and I...

304
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.749
We're...

305
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.489
a snowball on a roll.

306
00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:58.959
The snowball keeps getting bigger.

307
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.360
If you keep visiting me to break it,

308
00:24:02.659 --> 00:24:04.459
it'll be a waste of your time.

309
00:24:06.199 --> 00:24:07.370
Watch...

310
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.969
Pil Joo quietly.

311
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.610
Don't show that you know he's got the loan.

312
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.209
Pil Joo...

313
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.179
will cause big trouble one day...

314
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.850
for sure.

315
00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:38.229
(Mooshimwon)

316
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.650
Are you getting a loan from Mr. Cha?

317
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.150
Yes.

318
00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:54.919
For what?

319
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.590
When Honorary Chairman Jang sells...

320
00:24:59.189 --> 00:25:01.090
a batch of Cheong A Bio shares,

321
00:25:01.489 --> 00:25:03.019
I'm going to participate in taking over,

322
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.030
so I got the loan.

323
00:25:05.659 --> 00:25:07.689
Daeil Distribution that I gave you,

324
00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:11.530
Father's Cheong A Bio shares,

325
00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:15.540
and Cheong A shares you buy on a borrowed name...

326
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.110
I'm...

327
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.739
getting curious...

328
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.679
what your intention is.

329
00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:36.989
Executive Jung.

330
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.489
I'm...

331
00:25:41.699 --> 00:25:44.830
Kang Pil Joo who's called Jang Boo Cheon's dog.

332
00:25:46.969 --> 00:25:48.769
My intention is...

333
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.870
of course...

334
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.340
for Boo Cheon.

335
00:25:58.249 --> 00:25:59.409
Buying it...

336
00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:02.979
to protect Boo Cheon...

337
00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:05.820
when his control of the company is in danger?

338
00:26:19.729 --> 00:26:20.870
Pil Joo.

339
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.600
If...

340
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:26.269
you...

341
00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:28.140
betray me,

342
00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:30.409
I'll make you pay.

343
00:26:33.979 --> 00:26:37.120
Didn't you say Daeil Distribution shares I gave you...

344
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.989
as a compensation was more than you expected?

345
00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:44.989
If you betray me,

346
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.989
you'll have to pay...

347
00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:50.499
in a way that you've never seen before.

348
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:53.400
You won't even be able to imagine it.

349
00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:01.509
I thought it's best to...

350
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.780
tell you about how I feel...

351
00:27:05.479 --> 00:27:06.650
because...

352
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.850
people keep telling me...

353
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.689
about you.

354
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.330
I feel...

355
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.959
relieved now.

356
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.550
I...

357
00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:51.229
told Boo Cheon that I want a divorce, Mother.

358
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:52.689
Says who?

359
00:27:55.429 --> 00:27:56.600
Grandfather said...

360
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.600
he will never allow a divorce.

361
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:02.269
It'll ruin Boo Cheon's reputation.

362
00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:03.699
I don't think...

363
00:28:04.709 --> 00:28:08.140
I need anyone's permission to get a divorce.

364
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.640
You...

365
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:12.850
threatened me...

366
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.280
not to talk about a divorce...

367
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.390
even when you found out...

368
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.689
about Boo Cheon's affair.

369
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.689
Why do you want to get a divorce now?

370
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.189
I've changed my mind.

371
00:28:27.929 --> 00:28:28.959
I know.

372
00:28:29.929 --> 00:28:32.900
I'm asking what made you change your mind.

373
00:28:32.929 --> 00:28:34.169
I found out...

374
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.540
that money is related...

375
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:40.509
with my marriage.

376
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.150
Since you're getting a divorce because you don't want to be...

377
00:28:47.949 --> 00:28:49.679
- related with money, the alimony... - I asked Boo Cheon...

378
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.150
to give me the alimony and the fortune he got after the marriage.

379
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.259
What did you just say?

380
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.030
I said I asked him for...

381
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.459
alimony and division of property.

382
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.499
You can't divorce.

383
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.340
But I'll divide the property...

384
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.739
on a reasonable compromise.

385
00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:18.949
You'll feel better when you have your share.

386
00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:25.749
Why are you quiet?

387
00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:28.489
Mother.

388
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.489
I can't be happy in Mooshimwon anymore.

389
00:29:33.729 --> 00:29:36.199
Then where would you go?

390
00:29:36.929 --> 00:29:39.070
Who would you be happy with?

391
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:48.280
Are you...

392
00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:52.110
getting a divorce to live with Pil Joo?

393
00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:55.519
Pardon me?

394
00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.290
If you live with Pil Joo,

395
00:30:01.459 --> 00:30:02.719
it'll be the biggest pain...

396
00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.360
in Boo Cheon's life.

397
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.999
Mother.

398
00:30:09.459 --> 00:30:12.830
Don't split Boo Cheon and Pil Joo.

399
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.239
Think wise.

400
00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:18.169
For now,

401
00:30:19.239 --> 00:30:20.939
go rest at your mother's house for a few days.

402
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:27.780
Boo Cheon's going to be the official chairman soon.

403
00:30:29.949 --> 00:30:31.890
We must maintain a good mood.

404
00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:35.090
You must not ruin the mood.

405
00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:37.790
Mother.

406
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.630
Don't forget that I'm keeping Boo Cheon's secret.

407
00:30:44.929 --> 00:30:48.040
You should keep your manner to me.

408
00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:55.080
Also,

409
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040
the lawsuit...

410
00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.709
will take a while.

411
00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:02.249
Cheong A should take care of...

412
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.350
Boo Cheon's reputation on its own.

The boy you're holding...

416
00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.790
came to see me.

417
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.999
I don't think...

418
00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:51.429
I can keep your son...

419
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.229
who is holding grudge.

420
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.840
He's been waiting for 20 years.

421
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.509
I'm scared.

422
00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:20.189
Cheong A Group will become the holding company starting tomorrow.

423
00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:23.929
According to the share report that Cheong A submitted,

424
00:32:24.229 --> 00:32:26.630
Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon will be the representative...

425
00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:30.570
of Cheong A Holdings that's launching officially tomorrow.

426
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.310
It seems...

427
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.209
Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon's action in Cheong A Bio...

428
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.179
and his management skill contributed to this.

429
00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:40.050
From now,

430
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.019
Cheong A Group will officially become a holding company...

431
00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:44.850
with Chairman Jang Boo Cheon in the center.

432
00:32:53.459 --> 00:32:54.600
Boo Cheon...

433
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.360
will become the chairman...

434
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.929
of Cheong A tomorrow.

435
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.469
Yes, Executive Jung.

436
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.280
You, Boo Cheong,

437
00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:10.340
and I...

438
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.080
did it.

439
00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:19.949
Do you remember?

440
00:33:21.219 --> 00:33:24.219
The first night you came to Mooshimwon.

441
00:33:25.989 --> 00:33:27.290
Two of us...

442
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.030
talked about Boo Cheon becoming the chairman at that night.

443
00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:34.739
I asked you...

444
00:33:35.469 --> 00:33:37.040
to help lonely Boo Cheon...

445
00:33:37.769 --> 00:33:40.110
becoming the chairman.

446
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.840
You granted my favor...

447
00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:47.550
so perfectly.

448
00:33:50.449 --> 00:33:51.449
You're...

449
00:33:52.449 --> 00:33:53.919
such an amazing man.

450
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:59.890
If you...

451
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.900
study together with lonely Boo Cheon,

452
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:06.900
when Boo Cheon becomes...

453
00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:10.139
the chairman of Cheong A,

454
00:34:11.269 --> 00:34:13.209
I'll never forget what you've done for us.

(Vice Chairman Jang Boo Cheon becomes the chairman today.)

457
00:34:44.769 --> 00:34:46.939
Executive Jung wants you over.

458
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.800
It's Boo Cheon's inauguration tomorrow.

459
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.599
I feel uneasy about someone...

460
00:35:16.169 --> 00:35:18.470
on this happy event.

461
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.110
That's you, Secretary Oh.

462
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.720
If...

463
00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:31.820
I'm pressuring you that much,

464
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.789
I'll leave Mooshimwon.

465
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.189
Will you do that for me?

466
00:35:40.729 --> 00:35:41.800
Of course.

467
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.999
It's for you.

468
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.070
Right.

470
00:35:57.709 --> 00:35:58.950
is for me...

471
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.119
and for Boo Cheon.

Pardon?

477
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.150
You never told me you're quitting.

478
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:41.050
I want to take a break.

479
00:36:43.289 --> 00:36:45.930
It's about time now.

480
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.530
You worked for Mooshimwon even before I was born.

481
00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:53.599
- Yes. - Wherever you go,

482
00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:56.039
leave your contact number to Mom.

483

Yes.

484

Thank you.

very pleased inside.

509
00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:00.660
Pil Joo,

510
00:44:04.229 --> 00:44:05.369
let's go.

511
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.229
Chairman Jang Boo Cheon...

512
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.360
of Cheong A Bio is coming in.

513
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:53.680
(Cheong A Bio, Inauguration of Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

514
00:45:17.539 --> 00:45:22.510
(Cheong A Bio, Inauguration of Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

515
00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.209
Dear fellow members of Cheong A Bio.

516
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.380
I'm Jang Boo Cheon...

517
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.780
of Cheong A Bio, the holding company of Cheong A Group.

518
00:46:01.519 --> 00:46:03.479
Cheong A is about to make...

519
00:46:03.479 --> 00:46:05.050
a new leap forward.

520
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.459
I'll manage Cheong A with growth and innovation...

521
00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:10.260
at the core.

522
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.789
I, Jang Boo Cheon,

523
00:46:12.459 --> 00:46:13.930
will take the lead.

524
00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:18.269
I'd like to kindly ask you for your full support...

525
00:46:18.869 --> 00:46:20.130
and cooperation.

526
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.729
During the last two months,

527
00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:52.930
I went over the document Dad left.

528
00:46:55.039 --> 00:46:56.800
And I found...

529
00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:00.209
it had many policies regarding reformation of conglomerates.

530
00:47:03.039 --> 00:47:04.410
Going through the documents,

531
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.479
I thought to myself,

532
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.289
maybe I should...

533
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.519
work in politics someday.

534
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.389
The world Dad wanted to make.

535
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:20.260
I'll make it.

536
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.499
That's why I wanted to meet you and ask you for advice.

537
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.869
Politics.

538
00:47:28.769 --> 00:47:31.269
- It's not something anyone can do. - I'm not just anyone.

539
00:47:32.769 --> 00:47:34.639
I've watched my father work in politics...

540
00:47:35.209 --> 00:47:37.309
for 25 years since I was 10.

541
00:47:39.579 --> 00:47:40.809
He was...

542
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.349
a faithful...

543
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.550
and upright politician.

544
00:47:49.689 --> 00:47:52.729
Except that he got money from Cheong A Group at the end,

545
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.400
I should do...

546
00:47:56.459 --> 00:47:59.169
as I've been taught by Dad.

547
00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:03.340
I want to start...

548
00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:07.240
by running for the general election in Dad's local constituency.

549
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.280
(Cheong A Foundation Intranet)

550
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.249
This is blocked accounting documents of Cheong A Foundation.

551
00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:22.059
Please let me open the files.

552
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:24.959
There must be a problem.

553
00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:27.130
I will reveal it to the world...

554
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:29.559
using my name.

555
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.630
Then...

556
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.800
I might be able to win the nomination.

557
00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:39.639
All right.

558
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.280
I was forgetting...

559
00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:44.610
that...

560
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.309
you're Congressman Na Gi Chul's daughter.

561
00:49:24.849 --> 00:49:28.320
(Inauguration of Chairman Jang Boo Cheon)

562
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:40.829
Pil Joo.

563
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:44.570
Thank you.

564
00:50:05.059 --> 00:50:08.099
I once wanted to live idle with the money Dad left me.

565
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.329
But I've become the chairman of the holding company.

566
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:14.200
Now that I've become the chairman,

567
00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:18.439
I feel so happy.

568
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.010
Pil Joo.

569
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.280
You'll never know how I feel.

570
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.820
I'm happy for you.

571
00:50:32.019 --> 00:50:33.490
Now that you're happy,

572
00:50:37.459 --> 00:50:38.660
it makes me happy too.

573
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.329
Hey.

574
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.470
You're a friend of a chairman.

575
00:50:54.439 --> 00:50:56.780
This is the first call I get as the chairman.

576
00:50:57.809 --> 00:50:58.809
Hello?

577
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.450
Yes. I know Mr. Oh Ki Pyung.

578
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.090
The police?

579
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.430
(Police Station)

580
00:51:38.249 --> 00:51:40.519
I've suffered from depression for a long time.

581
00:51:41.289 --> 00:51:43.760
It's getting harder to live.

582
00:51:45.289 --> 00:51:47.090
I want to rest now.

583
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.630
Please have me cremated and scatter my ashes.

584
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:04.950
Boo Cheon.

585
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:08.050
I saw Secretary Oh.

586
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:10.220
And...

587
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.889
There's...

588
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:15.820
a suicide note?

589
00:52:17.419 --> 00:52:18.459
Yes.

590
00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.800
Don't tell Mom about it.

591
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:27.400
Okay. That'd be better.

592
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:03.059
I hung up the suit for the inauguration ceremony...

593
00:54:03.229 --> 00:54:04.769
in your dressing room.

594
00:54:05.369 --> 00:54:06.369
Okay.

595
00:54:06.999 --> 00:54:08.499
Just like your dad,

596
00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.570
you look good in a dark navy suit.

597
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:14.809
Mom. When you talk...

598
00:54:16.079 --> 00:54:17.950
about my dad,

599
00:54:18.079 --> 00:54:20.380
I sometimes feel confused about...

600
00:54:20.749 --> 00:54:22.519
which dad you're referring to.

601
00:54:25.689 --> 00:54:27.419
What's that supposed to mean?

602
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.689
Which dad?

603
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.729
I have two fathers.

604
00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.160
Vice President Soo Man.

605
00:54:34.289 --> 00:54:35.930
And someone else I don't know of.

606
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.700
My real father.

607
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200
My biological father.

608
00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:42.970
You don't have...

609
00:54:44.099 --> 00:54:46.769
any father other than Vice President Jang Soo Man.

610
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:48.079
Mom.

611
00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.849
For the past five years since I found I'm not the son of the Jangs,

612
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:54.079
I've never...

613
00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.019
talked about it...

614
00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.990
with you.

615
00:55:03.559 --> 00:55:04.689
Now that I'm having...

616
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:07.900
the inaugural ceremony tomorrow,

617
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.860
I wanted to talk about it with you for the first and the last time.

618
00:55:10.959 --> 00:55:11.970
I should...

619
00:55:13.169 --> 00:55:14.570
talk about it at least once.

620
00:55:16.099 --> 00:55:18.910
I have no idea what you're talking about.

621
00:55:21.139 --> 00:55:22.139
By the way,

622
00:55:25.249 --> 00:55:28.119
there's something I'm really curious about.

623
00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:31.919
Do I...

624
00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:35.419
even look like...

625
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.829
Vice President Jang Soo Man?

626
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.900
You're an absolute spitting image of him.

627
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:52.340
That's a relief.

628
00:55:54.809 --> 00:55:55.939
Don't you...

629
00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.209
ever say...

630
00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:02.320
that you have two fathers again. Okay?

631
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.249
Okay. Today is the last day.

632
00:56:08.289 --> 00:56:11.430
I'll forget all about it.

633
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.410
(Executive Jung Mal Ran)

634
00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:40.119
Executive Jung.

635
00:56:40.419 --> 00:56:42.320
All right.

636
00:56:43.289 --> 00:56:45.559
I'll go to the outhouse then.

637
00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.289
What is it?

638
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:24.130
I recorded the conversation between Executive Jung and Boo Cheon.

639
00:57:26.669 --> 00:57:28.939
Please play it after I leave.

640
00:57:29.369 --> 00:57:31.970
Also, you should listen to it by yourself.

641
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.910
Other people must not listen to it.

642
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.280
What are you up to this time?

643
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.880
I will get going then.

644
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.550
Mom,

645
00:59:24.079 --> 00:59:26.119
when you talked about my dad,

646
00:59:26.189 --> 00:59:28.619
I sometimes feel confused about...

647
00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.490
which dad you're referring to.

648
00:59:31.019 --> 00:59:32.829
What's that supposed to mean?

649
00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:34.530
Which dad?

650
00:59:34.729 --> 00:59:36.599
I have two fathers.

651
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.369
Vice President Soo Man.

652
00:59:38.499 --> 00:59:41.070
And someone else I don't know of. My real father.

653
00:59:42.070 --> 00:59:43.099
My biological father.

654
00:59:44.169 --> 00:59:45.539
You don't have...

655
00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:48.280
any father other than Vice President Jang Soo Man.

656
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.910
For the past five years...

657
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:53.309
since I found out I'm not the son of the Jangs,

658
00:59:53.749 --> 00:59:55.720
I've never talked about it...

659
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.380
with you.

660
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:22.039
You said...

661
01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.680
you had something to report privately.

662
01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.809
That's right.

663
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.050
I can't wait to hear it, Pil Joo.

664
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.889
You often said,

665
01:00:35.419 --> 01:00:36.559
"Executive Jung"

666
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:38.829
"It's such a sunny day."

667
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.300
"I'll go tell the housekeeper..."

668
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.900
"to bring you some tea to the garden."

669
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.530
And sometimes...

670
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:49.200
you asked me...

671
01:00:49.669 --> 01:00:51.539
to drink champagne together.

672
01:00:52.539 --> 01:00:54.539
Whenever you said that, something good happened.

673
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.599
Would it be...

674
01:01:19.669 --> 01:01:20.900
something...

675
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.070
even greater...

676
01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:27.240
than the news...

677
01:01:28.209 --> 01:01:29.439
that my son, Boo Cheon,

678
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:32.650
became the chairman?

679
01:01:38.389 --> 01:01:40.019
Go ahead, Pil Joo.

680
01:02:41.919 --> 01:02:43.150
I am here...

681
01:02:46.389 --> 01:02:47.519
to give you...

682
01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.559
the last work report,

683
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.599
Executive Jung.

684
01:03:30.459 --> 01:03:31.470
Executive Jung,

685
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.280
Jang Eun Cheon is...

686
01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:48.919
alive.

687
01:03:50.119 --> 01:03:51.150
And...

688
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:53.650
he is...

689
01:03:55.059 --> 01:03:56.160
even...

690
01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.630
very...

691
01:04:00.329 --> 01:04:01.760
near you.

692
01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.169
What are you talking about?

693
01:04:07.939 --> 01:04:08.970
Kang Pil Joo,

694
01:04:11.099 --> 01:04:13.669
the one right in front of you,

695
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:17.709
is...

696
01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:43.070

697
01:04:55.919 --> 01:04:57.450
