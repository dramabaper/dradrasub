(Episode 42)

4
00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:21.935
Quickly move the car.

5
00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:37.415
Lock the door.

6
00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:41.884
Ji Soo.

7
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:46.095
Ji Soo.

8
00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:50.994
No, Seo Ji Soo.

9
00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:52.634
Ji Soo.

10
00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:54.335
Let's go.

11
00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.524
What are you doing, Mr. Lee? Go catch them.

12
00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:29.765
Remember the shortcut I told you earlier?

13
00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:32.105
Take that road. Hurry up.

14
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.314
How dare you...

15
00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:07.774
Catch Seo Ji An. It's an abduction.

16
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.644
We can't, Ms. No.

17
00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:11.605
Your daughter is Seo Ji Soo now.

18
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.825
Your mother is the reporter?

19
00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:30.765
Yes.

20
00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:33.994
I was chasing her to give something.

21
00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:37.535
She must've been mistaken and reported it.

22
00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:39.105
What did you have to give to her?

23
00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:42.274
She'll know when you say it's Seo Ji Soo.

24
00:02:43.545 --> 00:02:45.344
You can confirm it with her.

25
00:02:45.705 --> 00:02:46.975
Ask the chief.

26
00:02:47.714 --> 00:02:50.114
I'll pay for the fine on speeding...

27
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.955
and reckless driving with my sincere apologies.

28
00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:54.515
Who is this woman?

29
00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:56.124
Oh, me?

30
00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:58.325
I was chasing him too.

31
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.994
He scratched my car while driving recklessly.

32
00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:03.065
I was delivering to the woodworking studio.

33
00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:04.594
Then why did you block the other car?

34
00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:06.235
Because he was chasing the car.

35
00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:08.494
I thought I had to stop that car to catch him.

36
00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:12.605
Let's reach a compromise.

37
00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:14.575
Sure.

38
00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:15.904
He says that we should let them go.

39
00:03:18.174 --> 00:03:20.515
Sign here, and you can go.

40
00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:34.494
But it's not covered by insurance...

41
00:03:34.494 --> 00:03:36.094
because it's a rental.

42
00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:41.535
Can I pay in cash?

43
00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:46.334
Can I repair it myself?

44
00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:49.135
My boss said I shouldn't cover it by insurance.

45
00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:50.804
Will you be able to pay...

46
00:03:51.274 --> 00:03:53.315
for the repair without going through insurance?

47
00:03:54.174 --> 00:03:55.614
Will you be able to pay...

48
00:03:55.614 --> 00:03:57.844
for the repair without going through insurance?

49
00:03:57.844 --> 00:03:59.455
Yes. I'll pay cash.

50
00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:00.455
Cash?

51
00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:02.885
It'll cost at least 2,000 dollars for the repair.

52
00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:03.924
What?

53
00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:06.654
Can't you just paint...

54
00:04:06.654 --> 00:04:08.195
the scratch on the bumper?

55
00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:12.165
Can you not...

56
00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:15.165
paint the whole thing?

57
00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.005
How much do you have?

58
00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:21.274
All I have right now...

59
00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.305
is 270 dollars.

60
00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.005
Then I'll take 200 dollars.

61
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.245
Right now.

62
00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:29.115
You have a good memory.

63
00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.844
But I'm not going to act cheap about it,

64
00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.084
or make you go work somewhere,

65
00:04:33.084 --> 00:04:35.055
or show off, so give me the money.

66
00:04:35.055 --> 00:04:36.185
I'll pay in installments.

67
00:04:51.234 --> 00:04:52.805
Did you know that?

68
00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:56.344
I've never asked for a discount.

69
00:04:57.404 --> 00:04:58.445
You're right.

70
00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:00.774
You asked me to paint partially.

71
00:05:01.774 --> 00:05:04.484
I said I'll just take 5,000 dollars.

72
00:05:05.584 --> 00:05:07.555
I was very grateful.

73
00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:11.255
I feel sorry.

74
00:05:12.955 --> 00:05:14.695
About what?

75
00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:16.594
I reported your fight with Yoon Ha Jung...

76
00:05:16.594 --> 00:05:18.094
and made you go to the police station.

77
00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:20.334
I made you spend the 5,000 dollars...

78
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:22.664
for settlement money when you had to give it to me.

79
00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:25.005
I'm the one who had a fight.

80
00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:26.234
You were going to be a regular employee,

81
00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:28.705
but it's our company who violated that promise.

82
00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:32.044
If I didn't say I'll take 5,000 dollars,

83
00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:34.745
you would've asked your boss to call insurance.

84
00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:36.185
Probably.

85
00:05:36.784 --> 00:05:38.815
Even though it's about becoming a regular job,

86
00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:40.955
I couldn't pay 20,000 dollars.

87
00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:43.584
If I didn't give you 20,000 dollars...

88
00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:45.724
to keep your pride,

89
00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:49.024
you wouldn't have asked my mother for the money.

90
00:05:50.294 --> 00:05:53.534
You wouldn't have rushed to join my family either.

91
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:58.104
I'm the villain in your life.

92
00:05:58.104 --> 00:05:59.774
Don't say that.

93
00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:04.044
You may have started it,

94
00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:07.245
but I made the choices.

95
00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:09.584
Seriously.

96
00:06:09.584 --> 00:06:11.714
Why do you keep blaming yourself?

97
00:06:11.714 --> 00:06:13.354
It's unlike you.

98
00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:14.755
Whenever I think about you,

99
00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.354
I feel sorry for so many things.

100
00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:21.594
That's because you still think I'm weak.

101
00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:23.394
I told you not to do that.

102
00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:25.164
You really don't have to do that.

103
00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:27.435
I'm really fine now.

104
00:07:08.774 --> 00:07:09.904
Was it you...

105
00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:12.344
who put two movie tickets on my desk?

106
00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:15.575
I had to pay back...

107
00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:17.284
for the vomit incident.

108
00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:19.555
So you got two movie tickets?

109
00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:22.055
Yes.

110
00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:25.084
What if I've gone with someone else?

111
00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:30.294
Isn't it so obvious that it's me?

112
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:32.125
Why?

113
00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:33.195
What do you mean?

114
00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:39.435
Does that mean you have many women who'd do that?

115
00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:42.274
Did you hope I don't?

116
00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:55.115
Ms. No.

117
00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:57.425
Yes?

118
00:07:57.425 --> 00:07:59.354
They're getting ready as you ordered.

119
00:08:02.594 --> 00:08:04.425
Okay. Get going.

120
00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.175
I have to go back.

121
00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:24.544
You're funny.

122
00:08:24.644 --> 00:08:27.284
What are you doing? Why did you come get me?

123
00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:30.284
I have to go back now.

124
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.624
Drive me back there.

125
00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:35.155
- Let's go to the airport. - Calm down, Ji Soo.

126
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:38.895
You opened the door yourself and held my hand.

127
00:08:40.065 --> 00:08:42.035
Well, I was confused.

128
00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:44.535
I didn't realize what I was doing.

129
00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:45.565
No.

130
00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:49.175
You looked happy when you saw me.

131
00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:52.045
That... That's not true.

132
00:08:53.214 --> 00:08:56.584
I only came with you because it was chaotic.

133
00:08:57.244 --> 00:08:59.145
I must get back now.

134
00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:03.185
Ji Soo.

135
00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:07.754
What you're worried about made you leave, right?

136
00:09:09.494 --> 00:09:11.895
But how did you know I was leaving?

137
00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:14.895
How did Do Kyung and Ji An know?

138
00:09:14.895 --> 00:09:16.334
What do you think?

139
00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:19.604
We all came for you when we heard the news.

140
00:09:23.374 --> 00:09:25.305
I couldn't let you leave like this.

141
00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:26.815
No,

142
00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:29.584
the three of us couldn't let you go.

143
00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:33.214
Even you too?

144
00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:37.825
It seems so.

145
00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:45.994
I sent you the auto shop number. Take care of it.

146
00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:50.604
Yes. I sped up slightly, and the car broke down.

147
00:09:50.964 --> 00:09:53.205
Sorry. Get that done for me.

148
00:09:53.474 --> 00:09:55.775
We'll get there around the same time if you go now.

149
00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:57.575
Okay.

150
00:09:58.675 --> 00:10:00.815
Really? That's great.

151
00:10:01.575 --> 00:10:03.384
Call me again when you're close.

152
00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:06.185
What did he say?

153
00:10:07.014 --> 00:10:09.884
Hyuk explained what happened to Yong Gook.

154
00:10:10.254 --> 00:10:13.594
He'll guard the house, so Hyuk can bring her there.

155
00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:16.464
Does he think that...

156
00:10:16.494 --> 00:10:18.565
Mom will forcibly take Ji Soo?

157
00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:21.895
Probably.

158
00:10:22.964 --> 00:10:24.264
No way.

159
00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:27.734
He said that Ji Soo is really nervous.

160
00:10:30.474 --> 00:10:31.705
What will we do now?

161
00:10:31.945 --> 00:10:34.145
I bet she's infuriated.

162
00:10:35.415 --> 00:10:36.785
She probably is.

163
00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:40.815
Well, do you have a plan?

164
00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:45.484
When I found out she was forced to go abroad,

165
00:10:46.055 --> 00:10:47.795
I didn't have time to think of a plan.

166
00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:49.895
"I can't let Ji Soo leave."

167
00:10:49.994 --> 00:10:51.494
"I must not let Ji Soo leave."

168
00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:53.565
"Ji Soo is going to suffer there."

169
00:10:54.535 --> 00:10:55.864
Then let's quickly come up with a plan.

170
00:10:56.234 --> 00:10:57.604
A plan for what will happen soon.

171
00:10:58.805 --> 00:10:59.874
We should...

172
00:11:00.705 --> 00:11:03.104
figure out a plan after talking with Ji Soo.

173
00:11:03.104 --> 00:11:04.675
Her opinion is important.

174
00:11:05.775 --> 00:11:07.175
I'm scared of Ms. No,

175
00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:09.884
but I think we should put Ji Soo's opinion first.

176
00:12:05.264 --> 00:12:06.535
Hello, Officer Lee.

177
00:12:06.575 --> 00:12:08.634
Hello, what is the problem here?

178
00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:11.244
They committed illegal parking here.

179
00:12:11.374 --> 00:12:13.045
- I see. - Let's go.

180
00:12:18.084 --> 00:12:19.285
- They must've been busy. - Well...

181
00:12:20.055 --> 00:12:21.584
I'm sorry you couldn't attend the birthday party.

182
00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:27.724
I know. I'm disappointed too.

183
00:12:39.035 --> 00:12:40.734
She went to the share house?

184
00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:43.474
Should I tell them to bring her here?

185
00:12:44.945 --> 00:12:46.474
Why did she go there out of all places?

186
00:12:48.244 --> 00:12:50.185
We can't get involved with the share house.

187
00:12:54.254 --> 00:12:56.724
So this is the share house.

188
00:12:56.925 --> 00:12:58.555
This is where Ji An and you live.

189
00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:00.555
Six of us live here.

190
00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:02.455
Including Yong Gook, there are seven.

191
00:13:05.224 --> 00:13:06.234
What's wrong?

192
00:13:07.734 --> 00:13:09.864
I've been too nervous. That's all.

193
00:13:11.734 --> 00:13:13.374
It doesn't feel real.

194
00:13:14.075 --> 00:13:17.205
It feels surreal that I'm still here with you.

195
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:19.545
You will be safe and comfortable here.

196
00:13:20.514 --> 00:13:21.545
Ji Soo.

197
00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:23.984
Ji An.

198
00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:28.384
Ji Soo.

199
00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:33.994
My gosh, you forgot about your real brother.

200
00:13:34.994 --> 00:13:36.425
Do Kyung.

201
00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:40.165
Share your feelings later. Why don't we talk first?

202
00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:46.435
She told me she will ruin the cafe and the bakery.

203
00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:48.834
She threatened you?

204
00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:55.415
It didn't happen yet. How could you decide to leave?

205
00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:57.514
She could've been bluffing.

206
00:13:57.714 --> 00:14:00.484
No, they are more than capable of doing so.

207
00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:03.155
When I told her I won't go abroad,

208
00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:05.724
she took away Mom's restaurant.

209
00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.695
So to be honest,

210
00:14:10.864 --> 00:14:12.695
I'm still worried.

211
00:14:13.994 --> 00:14:15.165
Don't worry.

212
00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:17.634
I'll go meet our parents after I change.

213
00:14:18.464 --> 00:14:22.334
I was surprised to find out you also live here.

214
00:14:23.104 --> 00:14:25.575
Ji Soo, you should go in and get some rest.

215
00:14:25.974 --> 00:14:27.344
She almost collapsed.

216
00:14:27.344 --> 00:14:29.285
Okay. Ji Soo, let's go in.

217
00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.994
What's wrong with you?

218
00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:51.305
How could you like Ji Soo after liking Ji An?

219
00:14:52.004 --> 00:14:54.305
Ji An was my first love,

220
00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:56.405
but I like Ji Soo.

221
00:14:56.775 --> 00:14:58.175
I can't trust you.

222
00:14:59.145 --> 00:15:00.714
You want to be my sister's boyfriend?

223
00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:02.315
In your dreams.

224
00:15:05.415 --> 00:15:06.815
I am already her boyfriend.

225
00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:09.854
Hyuk, you are in big trouble now.

226
00:15:15.055 --> 00:15:17.094
Is this where you've been staying?

227
00:15:17.864 --> 00:15:19.025
Seo Ji Soo.

228
00:15:19.594 --> 00:15:21.665
Why did you pretend that you were happy there?

229
00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:24.104
You should've told me sooner.

230
00:15:30.474 --> 00:15:31.504
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:35.244
I didn't give you the chance to tell me.

232
00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:39.114
I was the only person you could talk about this.

233
00:15:41.484 --> 00:15:42.925
It was the same for you too, right?

234
00:15:45.354 --> 00:15:48.825
That's why you came to me that day, right?

235
00:15:49.925 --> 00:15:52.025
I was the only one you could talk to.

236
00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:00.775
Ji Soo.

237
00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:04.405
But I slapped you.

238
00:16:06.014 --> 00:16:08.244
You thought I was going to be on your side.

239
00:16:15.254 --> 00:16:16.925
I only had you.

240
00:16:19.325 --> 00:16:21.195
I was sorry and humiliated,

241
00:16:22.825 --> 00:16:24.795
but you were the only one I could rely on.

242
00:16:26.994 --> 00:16:28.565
That's why you went to end your life.

243
00:16:31.305 --> 00:16:32.504
How did you know?

244
00:16:34.334 --> 00:16:35.775
On my way to the airport,

245
00:16:36.945 --> 00:16:38.945
I felt like I was on my way to end my life.

246
00:16:42.445 --> 00:16:45.545
"This is the last time I'll be Seo Ji Soo."

247
00:16:47.084 --> 00:16:48.714
"When I come back after the training,"

248
00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:52.425
"I'll be Choi Eun Seok." When I thought about that,

249
00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:55.994
everything that'd happened flashed by.

250
00:16:56.764 --> 00:16:58.165
Do you need another reason?

251
00:16:58.425 --> 00:17:00.494
I just like you for who you are.

252
00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:02.705
I met her after 10 years by chance.

253
00:17:03.764 --> 00:17:05.564
But she has a lot of things going on.

254
00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:08.875
I cared for her and ended up helping her.

255
00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:10.875
Someone I know...

256
00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:17.544
climbed the mountain at night to end her life.

257
00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:20.284
Why did she go to the mountain to do that?

258
00:17:22.254 --> 00:17:23.955
Because she was determined to kill herself.

259
00:17:27.024 --> 00:17:29.494
I am worried that Ji An might do something stupid.

260
00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:31.324
I'm worried she might never come back.

261
00:17:35.595 --> 00:17:37.605
I could finally connect the dots.

262
00:17:38.804 --> 00:17:40.074
I could do that only then.

263
00:17:41.304 --> 00:17:44.405
I'm fine now. It's all in the past now.

264
00:17:46.345 --> 00:17:47.544
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:50.115 --> 00:17:51.385
I'm sorrier.

266
00:17:52.915 --> 00:17:54.415
After staying with that family,

267
00:17:55.685 --> 00:17:57.724
I learned how they are,

268
00:17:59.794 --> 00:18:02.254
but I believed you when you said you were happy.

269
00:18:03.524 --> 00:18:06.695
I really thought you hated me.

270
00:18:07.865 --> 00:18:09.564
How could I ever hate you?

271
00:18:10.635 --> 00:18:12.165
You were my other half.

272
00:18:28.214 --> 00:18:30.425
This share house turned into a hiding place.

273
00:18:31.425 --> 00:18:32.524
What should we do now?

274
00:18:33.794 --> 00:18:36.494
I'm sure Mother was just scaring Ji Soo.

275
00:18:37.224 --> 00:18:38.464
Don't worry too much.

276
00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:40.435
I'm not too worried.

277
00:18:41.234 --> 00:18:43.464
I've thought about it too.

278
00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:45.974
Whatever you imagine,

279
00:18:46.605 --> 00:18:47.974
it might be worse than that.

280
00:18:57.445 --> 00:18:58.484
Do Kyung.

281
00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:04.185
Why are you coming? I said I'm going alone.

282
00:19:04.254 --> 00:19:07.054
No. Ms. No saw me.

283
00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:08.625
I have to apologize too.

284
00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:10.895
I will talk to her well.

285
00:19:10.895 --> 00:19:13.865
If I don't go, she will be even more upset.

286
00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:15.294
She might misunderstand me too.

287
00:19:15.564 --> 00:19:17.105
I want to tell her...

288
00:19:17.105 --> 00:19:19.534
I had to do it...

289
00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:20.705
regardless of you.

290
00:19:21.574 --> 00:19:23.175
Even though I expect I'll get seriously yelled at.

291
00:19:25.845 --> 00:19:26.845
Okay then.

292
00:19:27.244 --> 00:19:29.845
Since we did it together, let's fix it together.

293
00:19:40.494 --> 00:19:42.625
Did Ji Soo have a boyfriend?

294
00:19:42.994 --> 00:19:45.324
How could she get off the car there?

295
00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:47.234
Can you understand her?

296
00:19:47.234 --> 00:19:48.365
She's the daughter of Haesung Corporation.

297
00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:50.804
I am sending her there to be like one.

298
00:19:50.835 --> 00:19:52.875
Will you calm down a little first?

299
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:54.304
This is very unlike you.

300
00:19:54.304 --> 00:19:56.845
How can I calm down? I only get more upset.

301
00:19:57.645 --> 00:20:00.175
She shook off my hand and went to his car.

302
00:20:02.074 --> 00:20:04.415
You said Do Kyung and Ji An were there too.

303
00:20:05.014 --> 00:20:06.284
If they went there,

304
00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:07.885
there must be a good reason.

305
00:20:08.455 --> 00:20:10.185
Is that important at this point?

306
00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:12.655
We have to think about how to get Ji Soo back.

307
00:20:14.095 --> 00:20:16.294
Do Kyung and Ji An are here.

308
00:20:36.744 --> 00:20:37.945
Leave, Ji An.

309
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.185
How dare you enter here with Do Kyung?

310
00:20:41.585 --> 00:20:42.724
Do Kyung is enough.

311
00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:44.125
Let's talk after that girl leaves.

312
00:20:44.125 --> 00:20:46.494
No. You should both sit.

313
00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:48.794
They did this together,

314
00:20:48.794 --> 00:20:50.524
so I need to hear from both of them.

315
00:20:51.794 --> 00:20:53.034
I am sorry.

316
00:21:00.675 --> 00:21:03.105
I heard you blocked the car on the way...

317
00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:04.804
to the airport and took Ji Soo.

318
00:21:05.405 --> 00:21:07.514
Ji Soo's boyfriend helped you too.

319
00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.645
I asked Ji An for help.

320
00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.885
I couldn't let Ji Soo go.

321
00:21:13.214 --> 00:21:14.814
What do you mean you couldn't let her go?

322
00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:17.784
- Ji Soo... - I scared her a little.

323
00:21:19.294 --> 00:21:20.494
What do you mean?

324
00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:22.195
What did you say to her?

325
00:21:24.824 --> 00:21:27.064
Why on earth did you take part in it?

326
00:21:27.064 --> 00:21:28.195
Do you think you have a say in this?

327
00:21:28.195 --> 00:21:30.205
I know Ji Soo well.

328
00:21:30.335 --> 00:21:32.335
She won't be able to manage studying abroad.

329
00:21:32.335 --> 00:21:33.875
She needs to be taken care of.

330
00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.705
And she can't survive where she...

331
00:21:36.804 --> 00:21:37.845
doesn't want to go.

332
00:21:37.845 --> 00:21:39.814
It's none of your business.

333
00:21:39.945 --> 00:21:41.044
Who are you to say so?

334
00:21:41.044 --> 00:21:42.685
Ji Soo is my little sister.

335
00:21:44.044 --> 00:21:46.115
Don't try to fool me with your words.

336
00:21:46.814 --> 00:21:49.014
You lied about living with Do Kyung...

337
00:21:49.014 --> 00:21:50.585
in that house.

338
00:21:51.284 --> 00:21:52.284
Mother, that is...

339
00:21:52.284 --> 00:21:53.554
Don't say anything, Do Kyung.

340
00:21:54.524 --> 00:21:56.794
You were living under the same roof,

341
00:21:56.794 --> 00:21:58.564
and yet you said you weren't interested.

342
00:21:58.564 --> 00:22:00.135
You said you hated our family.

343
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:01.564
I didn't lie.

344
00:22:02.034 --> 00:22:03.935
I didn't ask him for permission,

345
00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:05.974
and he didn't want you to know.

346
00:22:05.974 --> 00:22:08.304
I just couldn't tell on him.

347
00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:11.845
And I knew you'd find out soon enough...

348
00:22:11.945 --> 00:22:14.115
even if I don't tell you about it.

349
00:22:14.474 --> 00:22:16.544
I went into that house because of Yong Gook.

350
00:22:17.915 --> 00:22:20.155
I knew Ji An was there,

351
00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:21.415
so I moved in there.

352
00:22:21.415 --> 00:22:23.754
Whatever you say is not important.

353
00:22:24.185 --> 00:22:25.524
Words are meaningless, aren't they?

354
00:22:25.724 --> 00:22:27.695
I am moving back to my family home soon.

355
00:22:29.595 --> 00:22:31.264
You don't have to worry about Ji An.

356
00:22:32.294 --> 00:22:34.564
I will keep the promise I made to you.

357
00:22:38.034 --> 00:22:39.034
Ji Soo...

358
00:22:42.105 --> 00:22:44.744
I hope you will let Ji Soo live the way she wants.

359
00:22:44.744 --> 00:22:45.774
Get out!

360
00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:48.375
Was my son not enough?

361
00:22:48.375 --> 00:22:50.214
Now, you're trying to ruin my daughter's life too?

362
00:22:50.544 --> 00:22:52.244
You want to ruin her...

363
00:22:52.244 --> 00:22:53.714
because she got everything you ever wanted, right?

364
00:22:59.425 --> 00:23:01.595
We heard enough. You should go, Ji An.

365
00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:03.625
Yes.

366
00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:06.865
I will go now.

367
00:23:15.734 --> 00:23:17.105
You told her...

368
00:23:17.474 --> 00:23:19.074
that you will destroy Ji Soo's boyfriend,

369
00:23:19.244 --> 00:23:20.814
his sister's cafe,

370
00:23:21.244 --> 00:23:23.085
and his brother-in-law's bakery...

371
00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:24.885
if she didn't go study abroad.

372
00:23:25.415 --> 00:23:26.984
Did you agree to this?

373
00:23:27.685 --> 00:23:28.685
What?

374
00:23:29.185 --> 00:23:30.724
When I told her to go, she refused.

375
00:23:30.724 --> 00:23:32.695
She was so upset about it.

376
00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:34.455
It was all because of that man.

377
00:23:34.754 --> 00:23:37.324
Mother, how could you do this to her?

378
00:23:38.464 --> 00:23:40.734
Even I couldn't believe it when Ji Soo told me.

379
00:23:40.865 --> 00:23:43.635
You couldn't believe it? Why?

380
00:23:46.105 --> 00:23:48.105
I was only bending some rules and using tricks...

381
00:23:48.105 --> 00:23:49.905
to send her abroad...

382
00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:51.074
and to protect our family.

383
00:23:51.345 --> 00:23:52.714
You should know that better than anyone.

384
00:23:52.714 --> 00:23:54.274
How could you do such a ridiculous thing?

385
00:23:54.814 --> 00:23:56.385
Bring Ji Soo back right now.

386
00:23:58.415 --> 00:24:00.014
Do Kyung, you should go now.

387
00:24:00.685 --> 00:24:02.955
I need to know what you'll do with Ji Soo.

388
00:24:03.955 --> 00:24:06.355
Are you going to force her to go study abroad again?

389
00:24:06.895 --> 00:24:09.155
Upgrading her qualification is a must.

390
00:24:09.155 --> 00:24:10.494
I told you to go now!

391
00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:17.234
I will talk with your mother.

392
00:24:17.234 --> 00:24:19.375
Tell Ji Soo to relax for now.

393
00:24:20.875 --> 00:24:21.875
I will.

394
00:24:25.175 --> 00:24:26.445
I will go now.

395
00:24:33.455 --> 00:24:36.885
I need time to think.

396
00:24:52.705 --> 00:24:54.375
It's cold. You should've stayed in the car.

397
00:24:55.504 --> 00:24:56.504
Let's go.

398
00:25:10.024 --> 00:25:11.524
It's like I'm dreaming.

399
00:25:12.024 --> 00:25:14.224
I'm eating food you cooked for me.

400
00:25:14.855 --> 00:25:16.595
I never even imagined it.

401
00:25:17.294 --> 00:25:18.724
Don't be too afraid.

402
00:25:19.125 --> 00:25:21.335
Your sister and brother are here,

403
00:25:21.595 --> 00:25:22.665
and I am here too.

404
00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:25.605
I am sorry.

405
00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:28.875
Why are you sorry? It's not your fault.

406
00:25:30.175 --> 00:25:31.504
You're eating only now?

407
00:25:33.314 --> 00:25:34.574
What are you doing?

408
00:25:34.974 --> 00:25:36.784
Why are you feeding my sister only now?

409
00:25:37.214 --> 00:25:39.014
I didn't feel hungry.

410
00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:40.955
What happened?

411
00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:43.455
Father is going to talk with Mother.

412
00:25:43.524 --> 00:25:45.355
He said you shouldn't worry about it.

413
00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:47.695
Father didn't know.

414
00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:51.024
Did Father say I shouldn't worry?

415
00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:52.895
Is it possible?

416
00:25:53.195 --> 00:25:55.234
What do you want to do now?

417
00:25:55.564 --> 00:25:57.004
That's what matters the most.

418
00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:00.375
I want to go back to working at the bakery.

419
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:02.405
And I can't stay in my parents' house now,

420
00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:04.175
so I want to stay here for a while.

421
00:26:04.645 --> 00:26:06.375
Is that okay?

422
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:08.474
Of course. Your brother is here.

423
00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:19.824
Dad, I will find out and call you back.

424
00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:25.095
Why isn't she calling?

425
00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:30.165
(Contacts, Ji An)

426
00:26:32.335 --> 00:26:35.605
"Dad, Ji Soo didn't go. She came back."

427
00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:37.845
She came back?

428
00:26:39.314 --> 00:26:41.445
"I will visit you with Ji Soo soon..."

429
00:26:41.445 --> 00:26:43.385
"and explain what happened."

430
00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:46.784
But why did she come back?

431
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.885
I'm sorry. It's my alarm.

432
00:27:55.685 --> 00:27:56.784
What time is it?

433
00:27:56.784 --> 00:27:58.155
You should sleep more.

434
00:27:59.024 --> 00:28:00.794
I have to go to work. You should rest.

435
00:28:00.794 --> 00:28:01.794
Okay.

436
00:28:10.534 --> 00:28:11.734
I haven't seen that in a long time.

437
00:28:12.974 --> 00:28:14.135
There's me too.

438
00:28:15.034 --> 00:28:16.474
Of course.

439
00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:18.905
Good thing I didn't cancel the contract for this.

440
00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:19.915
- What? - Use this phone.

441
00:28:33.054 --> 00:28:34.695
My wife is not in the room.

442
00:28:34.824 --> 00:28:36.895
She left early in the morning.

443
00:28:39.335 --> 00:28:40.435
I see.

444
00:28:46.705 --> 00:28:49.574
She will come out at least once.

445
00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:51.804
When she comes out,

446
00:28:51.804 --> 00:28:53.175
make sure to catch her and bring her here.

447
00:29:10.895 --> 00:29:12.365
I... I am sorry.

448
00:29:13.264 --> 00:29:14.865
Why didn't you tell me ahead of time?

449
00:29:15.865 --> 00:29:17.865
I told you that you didn't have to go.

450
00:29:18.665 --> 00:29:20.274
I wanted to tell you.

451
00:29:20.605 --> 00:29:21.605
However,

452
00:29:22.004 --> 00:29:24.375
that would've made things too difficult for you.

453
00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:26.774
You work for Grandfather,

454
00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.974
and he decides everything.

455
00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:32.185
I thought...

456
00:29:32.185 --> 00:29:34.355
I could put you in a difficult position.

457
00:29:37.185 --> 00:29:38.955
So it was hard for you to trust me.

458
00:29:41.355 --> 00:29:44.324
It's okay. You called me now.

459
00:29:45.195 --> 00:29:46.195
Yes.

460
00:29:47.835 --> 00:29:49.095
Help me.

461
00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:53.105
I just want to live as Seo Ji Soo.

462
00:29:53.675 --> 00:29:55.504
I don't want to live as Choi Eun Seok.

463
00:29:56.675 --> 00:29:57.744
Help me,

464
00:29:58.675 --> 00:30:00.014
Father.

465
00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:10.754
Do Kyung and Ji An formed an alliance?

466
00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:12.455
Ji Soo is staying...

467
00:30:13.095 --> 00:30:14.294
at Yong Gook's place,

468
00:30:14.294 --> 00:30:15.595
so I can't just barge into the house.

469
00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:18.764
Do Kyung and Ji An...

470
00:30:19.024 --> 00:30:20.595
I can't leave Ji Soo there.

471
00:30:20.595 --> 00:30:22.095
I told you it wasn't going to be easy.

472
00:30:22.095 --> 00:30:23.905
I have to go get back Ji Soo.

473
00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:28.004
Eun Seok is not important here.

474
00:30:28.205 --> 00:30:29.804
I have a very bad feeling about this.

475
00:30:32.814 --> 00:30:36.115
It won't be easy to control Do Kyung.

476
00:30:36.115 --> 00:30:37.685
What should we do?

477
00:30:40.054 --> 00:30:42.085
Their relationship is completely entangled.

478
00:30:44.185 --> 00:30:46.625
Ji An is not to be undermined.

479
00:30:47.195 --> 00:30:48.695
Ji Soo comes first now.

480
00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:51.064
I can't give up on Ji Soo.

481
00:30:54.195 --> 00:30:56.865
Do Kyung will come home soon.

482
00:30:58.464 --> 00:31:01.335
He hasn't forgotten he's the successor of Haesung.

483
00:31:02.074 --> 00:31:03.705
But if I don't fix Ji Soo now,

484
00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:05.274
she will just age as a nobody.

485
00:31:06.274 --> 00:31:09.214
I can't leave my daughter end up like that.

486
00:31:09.314 --> 00:31:10.484
I am No Myung Hee.

487
00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:13.955
I can't see my daughter living such a shabby life.

488
00:31:14.615 --> 00:31:15.615
I can't bear it.

489
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:18.054
You can't give up on Eun Seok?

490
00:31:18.054 --> 00:31:19.994
I can't give up on Do Kyung.

491
00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:20.994
Father.

492
00:31:20.994 --> 00:31:22.494
You take care of Ji Soo.

493
00:31:22.494 --> 00:31:24.095
I will take care of Do Kyung.

494
00:31:59.435 --> 00:32:00.534
Oh?

495
00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:02.835
You left just yesterday.

496
00:32:03.205 --> 00:32:04.764
Why did you come again?

497
00:32:05.635 --> 00:32:06.875
I came because of Ji Soo.

498
00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:12.405
What? Who could that be? Who is it?

499
00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:14.214
I am Ji Soo's grandfather.

500
00:32:18.544 --> 00:32:21.054
It... It's Ji Soo's grandfather.

501

00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:44.744
I knew about...

503
00:32:46.774 --> 00:32:49.744
all the shameless things you've done,

504
00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:53.355
and yet I didn't see you. But I am here today.

505
00:32:54.885 --> 00:32:55.885
It was...

506
00:32:57.724 --> 00:33:00.155
because you were worthless.

507
00:33:00.224 --> 00:33:01.455
But now, I realize...

508
00:33:03.224 --> 00:33:05.095
that avenging you would get me nothing,

509
00:33:05.095 --> 00:33:06.794
and I'd just waste my energy.

510
00:33:06.794 --> 00:33:07.935
So I just let it go.

511
00:33:09.734 --> 00:33:11.464
- I am very sorry. - Stop that.

512
00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:14.705
I hate people saying meaningless things.

513
00:33:14.705 --> 00:33:16.705
Words mean nothing.

514
00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:23.085
Then may I ask you why you are here?

515
00:33:23.345 --> 00:33:27.655
Your daughter, Ji An, is unbelievably...

516
00:33:29.155 --> 00:33:31.585
distressing me.

517
00:33:33.524 --> 00:33:35.355
Ji... Ji An?

518
00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:38.524
Did Ji An do something wrong?

519
00:33:38.695 --> 00:33:41.064
It's something to do with my grandson, Do Kyung.

520
00:33:44.304 --> 00:33:47.175
I don't know if it's love or attachment.

521
00:33:49.074 --> 00:33:50.605
But something that should never happen...

522
00:33:50.605 --> 00:33:51.974
is happening right now.

523
00:33:52.675 --> 00:33:53.744
What?

524
00:33:56.945 --> 00:33:59.955
- You're surprised. - I came to see that.

525
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:03.984
You should keep her under control...

526
00:34:03.984 --> 00:34:06.794
before it's too late and I get blood on my hands.

527
00:34:07.855 --> 00:34:09.694
I am sorry,

528
00:34:10.864 --> 00:34:12.835
but did Ji An confirm this?

529
00:34:12.835 --> 00:34:14.835
Did she say she was with your grandson?

530
00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:16.804
If you were her, would you admit to it?

531
00:34:17.605 --> 00:34:19.304
What... What do you mean?

532
00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:21.835
Do you think she'd admit that they're together?

533
00:34:22.474 --> 00:34:24.705
Then are you saying...

534
00:34:24.904 --> 00:34:26.744
Ji An denied it?

535
00:34:27.074 --> 00:34:29.014
Are you playing word games with me?

536
00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:32.384
If my daughter said it's not true,

537
00:34:32.784 --> 00:34:33.855
it must not be true.

538
00:34:34.685 --> 00:34:35.715
What?

539
00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:38.085
Ji An doesn't lie.

540
00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:39.994
If she's with him, she would say it.

541
00:34:40.494 --> 00:34:42.324
She'd rather get hit a thousand times...

542
00:34:42.395 --> 00:34:44.764
rather than lie about something.

543
00:34:45.994 --> 00:34:48.165
You can never know about your child's mind.

544
00:34:48.165 --> 00:34:50.005
You foolish man.

545
00:34:50.634 --> 00:34:53.705
You can never know what's in someone's mind.

546
00:34:53.974 --> 00:34:55.634
That's how complicated it is.

547
00:34:57.045 --> 00:34:59.105
Do you have to be really sad to cry?

548
00:34:59.344 --> 00:35:01.174
Do you laugh because you're really happy?

549
00:35:01.444 --> 00:35:04.085
You judge things based on your standards.

550
00:35:05.444 --> 00:35:06.784
You pathetic man.

551
00:35:09.824 --> 00:35:12.384
You stole another man's daughter and sold yours.

552
00:35:12.654 --> 00:35:14.855
I was going to let go of that.

553
00:35:15.094 --> 00:35:18.264
But now, you say you raised your daughter well.

554
00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:21.264
You make me laugh by talking nonsense.

555
00:35:21.264 --> 00:35:22.295
That's human.

556
00:35:22.295 --> 00:35:23.965
You don't know anything about what you did.

557
00:35:23.965 --> 00:35:24.965
You completely forgot.

558
00:35:26.605 --> 00:35:28.074
"You sow what you reap", right?

559
00:35:28.775 --> 00:35:30.205
You raised her,

560
00:35:31.005 --> 00:35:32.944
and you're saying that she's honest?

561
00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:36.145
She's a witch.

562
00:35:36.514 --> 00:35:39.215
The way she handles men is unbelievable.

563
00:35:39.355 --> 00:35:42.154
How dare she dream of becoming my family?

564
00:35:42.154 --> 00:35:43.424
It's not true.

565
00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:47.054
Ji An is not what you say.

566
00:35:47.554 --> 00:35:49.824
The person who did your family wrong is me.

567
00:35:50.094 --> 00:35:52.494
Yes. Call me a child kidnapper,

568
00:35:52.494 --> 00:35:53.864
and slap me in the face.

569
00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:57.165
You should avenge me for your lost 25 years...

570
00:35:57.165 --> 00:35:58.605
with your granddaughter.

571
00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:00.505
No, if you want to kill me,

572
00:36:00.674 --> 00:36:02.435
you may kill me. However,

573
00:36:03.304 --> 00:36:05.605
don't treat Ji An badly.

574
00:36:07.014 --> 00:36:08.875
There's no way Ji An would want...

575
00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:10.344
to get involved with your grandson.

576
00:36:10.344 --> 00:36:13.514
I know my daughter. I know her that much.

577
00:36:17.685 --> 00:36:18.824
Are you saying...

578
00:36:19.855 --> 00:36:22.295
I don't know my grandson?

579
00:36:23.625 --> 00:36:25.125
It seems like you didn't know.

580
00:36:31.364 --> 00:36:35.835
That's for kidnapping my daughter 25 years ago.

581
00:36:37.074 --> 00:36:38.174
This is...

582
00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:41.844
for sending your daughter to my house...

583
00:36:42.815 --> 00:36:45.415
and letting my grandson see...

584
00:36:47.284 --> 00:36:49.324
- Honey, are you okay? - Don't!

585
00:36:52.724 --> 00:36:55.424
Stay here. Stay here for now.

586
00:37:05.105 --> 00:37:07.974
That was a mistake.

587
00:37:27.295 --> 00:37:28.554
I am...

588
00:37:29.724 --> 00:37:31.125
sorry about what we did to Ji Soo.

589
00:37:32.224 --> 00:37:33.634
I am sorry.

590
00:37:37.565 --> 00:37:38.735
Tae Soo,

591
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:42.705
I will make your son and daughter-in-law...

592
00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:44.275
lose their jobs...

593
00:37:44.275 --> 00:37:46.645
and destroy the lives...

594
00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:49.815
of the rest of your family.

595
00:37:49.884 --> 00:37:51.315
I came here to warn you that.

596
00:37:52.815 --> 00:37:55.755
Because I give everyone just one more chance.

597
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:00.424
Don't forget.

598
00:38:01.755 --> 00:38:02.895
You...

599
00:38:03.424 --> 00:38:07.295
deserved to get slapped.

600
00:38:08.335 --> 00:38:09.534
That's who you are.

601
00:38:11.335 --> 00:38:12.735
I get it.

602
00:38:18.645 --> 00:38:20.014
Tell Ji An...

603
00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:22.815
everything you saw.

604
00:39:15.165 --> 00:39:17.065
Mi Jung, did you have a visitor...

605
00:39:17.364 --> 00:39:19.235
My goodness. Hey, Tae Soo.

606
00:39:23.974 --> 00:39:26.444
Please don't tell Tae Soo about imaginary cancer...

607
00:39:26.444 --> 00:39:28.815
until his anger melts away.

608
00:39:34.014 --> 00:39:35.755
Why is your face so red?

609
00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:38.125
Did you get hit in the face?

610
00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:41.824
Go... Go to your room, and get some rest.

611
00:39:41.824 --> 00:39:43.994
Hae Ja, can you come by some time later?

612
00:39:43.994 --> 00:39:46.665
Okay. I will.

613
00:40:03.784 --> 00:40:05.545
Let's meet during the lunch hour.

614
00:40:09.384 --> 00:40:11.554
You like citrus tea, so...

615
00:40:13.054 --> 00:40:14.795
I'll go back home for now.

616
00:40:15.654 --> 00:40:17.025
Are you coming back home?

617
00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:19.764
Father is sick too.

618
00:40:19.764 --> 00:40:21.895
He'd be worried if I'm not there.

619
00:40:24.034 --> 00:40:26.005
But don't tell him I'm pregnant.

620
00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:28.335
We can't celebrate it.

621
00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:32.045
Once Father gets better,

622
00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:35.415
let's tell them about our situation.

623
00:40:40.884 --> 00:40:42.215
Nothing will change.

624
00:40:42.985 --> 00:40:44.384
Don't stare at me like that.

625
00:40:46.494 --> 00:40:47.554
Thank you...

626
00:40:49.094 --> 00:40:50.494
anyway.

627
00:40:51.525 --> 00:40:52.694
For caring about my father.

628
00:40:54.165 --> 00:40:57.534
That's the least I can do in my situation.

629
00:40:59.105 --> 00:41:00.134
All right.

630
00:41:01.235 --> 00:41:02.275
But...

631
00:41:03.674 --> 00:41:04.775
let's not do that.

632
00:41:06.514 --> 00:41:07.545
What?

633
00:41:07.614 --> 00:41:09.884
Things are unsettled at home now.

634
00:41:10.614 --> 00:41:12.344
You'd feel uncomfortable and uneasy there.

635
00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:16.025
I'll tell them we had a fight.

636
00:41:16.585 --> 00:41:18.485
You can stay with Seung Hun for a while.

637
00:41:19.455 --> 00:41:21.194
Because things are unsettled?

638
00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:24.165
Is it because of the baby?

639
00:41:24.165 --> 00:41:26.034
I just don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

640
00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:31.065
Father will get better in about a month.

641
00:41:32.605 --> 00:41:34.705
We're trying hard to comfort him now.

642
00:41:35.574 --> 00:41:39.244
And there's no reason for you to do that.

643
00:41:42.884 --> 00:41:44.215
Okay.

644
00:41:45.955 --> 00:41:47.715
I'd be more comfortable that way.

645
00:41:48.815 --> 00:41:50.985
Call me whenever you need me.

646
00:41:51.224 --> 00:41:53.824
Tell me if you need me to do anything for you.

647
00:41:55.025 --> 00:41:56.424
That's not going to happen.

648
00:41:57.795 --> 00:41:59.494
I should get ready to stand on my own.

649
00:42:28.054 --> 00:42:30.625
Please come, and take a look at the dresses.

650
00:42:31.224 --> 00:42:33.494
We have various styles. Please take a look.

651
00:42:33.494 --> 00:42:35.494
Do you have this one in a different color?

652
00:42:36.505 --> 00:42:39.034
Yes. We have only one left now.

653
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:41.105
But it would look great on you.

654
00:42:41.605 --> 00:42:44.804
I have dark skin. I don't look good in green.

655
00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:52.654
It's not selling well today.

656
00:42:53.755 --> 00:42:55.815
Wouldn't that be because I wasn't here?

657
00:42:56.755 --> 00:42:58.154
What took you so long?

658
00:42:58.154 --> 00:43:00.395
You said you'd bring Ji Soo's clothes.

659
00:43:01.295 --> 00:43:02.895
I couldn't bring them...

660
00:43:02.895 --> 00:43:04.364
because the owner of the clothes came back.

661
00:43:04.724 --> 00:43:06.465
The owner of the clothes came back?

662
00:43:12.775 --> 00:43:17.244
Are you saying your brother left the house...

663
00:43:17.244 --> 00:43:18.944
because of my sister?

664
00:43:18.944 --> 00:43:21.974
Yes. I had no idea.

665
00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:25.045
Do Kyung and Ji An are so silly, aren't they?

666
00:43:25.045 --> 00:43:26.915
Why would they give up on Haesung Corporation?

667
00:43:29.485 --> 00:43:31.154
What is Ji An going to do?

668
00:43:55.674 --> 00:43:56.884
You should go.

669
00:43:57.485 --> 00:43:58.485
Why?

670
00:43:58.485 --> 00:44:00.585
This is a total emergency.

671
00:44:00.585 --> 00:44:02.585
You and I being friends?

672
00:44:02.585 --> 00:44:04.085
That's just not right.

673
00:44:04.085 --> 00:44:05.085
What?

674
00:44:06.255 --> 00:44:08.324
Okay. That's true.

675
00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:11.194
So just go.

676
00:44:11.864 --> 00:44:13.735
I don't want your family to see this.

677
00:44:19.165 --> 00:44:20.605
Hello.

678
00:44:20.605 --> 00:44:23.304
We have coats and padded jackets.

679
00:44:23.304 --> 00:44:25.844
Try on this coat. It'd look good on you.

680
00:44:25.844 --> 00:44:26.974
This coat.

681
00:44:27.574 --> 00:44:28.844
Try on this coat.

682
00:44:28.844 --> 00:44:31.815
How could he send me back just like that?

683
00:44:38.324 --> 00:44:41.194
You found a factory to take over?

684
00:44:42.494 --> 00:44:45.224
I called some factories to ask for a tour.

685
00:44:45.224 --> 00:44:47.534
And there was a factory that was up for auction.

686
00:44:47.534 --> 00:44:49.364
You can take it over. It's out for quick sale.

687
00:44:49.364 --> 00:44:52.165
The annual capacity is 600 tons?

688
00:44:52.835 --> 00:44:55.174
- That's not bad. - And it's in Bucheon.

689
00:44:55.174 --> 00:44:56.545
It's close to carpentry shops in Seoul...

690
00:44:56.545 --> 00:44:58.505
and lumber mills in Incheon.

691
00:44:58.505 --> 00:45:00.645
How long has it been since they closed it down?

692
00:45:01.545 --> 00:45:03.444
It's been about three months.

693
00:45:03.444 --> 00:45:05.145
Then we should try to take over this factory.

694
00:45:05.145 --> 00:45:07.114
Find the factory manager who worked here first.

695
00:45:11.455 --> 00:45:12.654
What is it you wanted to tell me?

696
00:45:13.625 --> 00:45:16.065
Myung Hee. Why don't we...

697
00:45:17.864 --> 00:45:21.735
let our daughter, Ji Soo, off this time?

698
00:45:23.235 --> 00:45:24.864
Is that what this was about?

699
00:45:24.864 --> 00:45:26.005
I want to let Ji Soo...

700
00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:28.335
live a life that she wants.

701
00:45:30.944 --> 00:45:32.505
She's a college graduate,

702
00:45:32.505 --> 00:45:34.014
works at a local bakery,

703
00:45:34.014 --> 00:45:36.415
and dates a man with terrible backgrounds.

704
00:45:36.415 --> 00:45:38.815
That's the life our daughter wants to live.

705
00:45:38.815 --> 00:45:40.715
That all happened because we lost her.

706
00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:43.255
That's why we should put things back.

707
00:45:45.085 --> 00:45:47.855
Do you want her to be Choi Eun Seok like that?

708
00:45:47.855 --> 00:45:50.264
I can't let her be a laughing stock.

709
00:45:50.264 --> 00:45:51.324
Why not?

710
00:45:52.465 --> 00:45:54.494
Do you want to lose all your children?

711
00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:58.134
It's time we should...

712
00:45:58.235 --> 00:46:00.804
treat Do Kyung and Ji Soo with a different mindset.

713
00:46:00.804 --> 00:46:02.744
Dad will bring Do Kyung back.

714
00:46:02.744 --> 00:46:04.344
And I'll bring Ji Soo back.

715
00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:05.344
No, you won't.

716
00:46:06.444 --> 00:46:08.244
You won't be able to bring her back against her will.

717
00:46:09.045 --> 00:46:10.045
What did you say?

718
00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:12.215
You don't have the right to bring her back.

719
00:46:13.355 --> 00:46:15.154
Eun Seok is Seo Ji Soo now.

720
00:46:15.384 --> 00:46:16.625
She's not Choi Eun Seok.

721
00:46:17.724 --> 00:46:19.855
If you want to force Ji Soo to come back,

722
00:46:20.625 --> 00:46:21.824
you will have to...

723
00:46:21.824 --> 00:46:24.264
file a paternity suit against Ji Soo.

724
00:46:25.224 --> 00:46:27.235
Then it will become public.

725
00:46:27.235 --> 00:46:28.735
Are you sure you can file that lawsuit?

726
00:46:29.665 --> 00:46:32.134
What happened 25 years ago will rise once again.

727
00:46:33.335 --> 00:46:35.205
Your plan to launder...

728
00:46:35.205 --> 00:46:37.074
her academic background in secret?

729
00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:38.674
It won't happen then.

730
00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:41.074
People will pry into...

731
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.744
Ji Soo's academic and grown-up backgrounds.

732
00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:45.614
Would things stop there?

733
00:46:46.855 --> 00:46:49.154
Then people will even find out...

734
00:46:49.224 --> 00:46:50.755
that Ji An once joined our family.

735
00:46:51.884 --> 00:46:54.224
That's it? Is that what you've been looking into?

736
00:46:54.855 --> 00:46:55.895
That's it?

737
00:46:56.264 --> 00:46:58.924
Why are you being so soft-hearted?

738
00:46:58.924 --> 00:47:00.764
Maybe that's because I'm from an ordinary family.

739
00:47:01.895 --> 00:47:04.065
Ji Soo has probably got that from my blood.

740
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:08.174
Don't forget...

741
00:47:09.444 --> 00:47:11.804
that Ji Soo is not Choi Eun Seok now.

742
00:47:12.944 --> 00:47:14.275
If you force her to come,

743
00:47:15.145 --> 00:47:17.145
I'm not going to let it slide.

744
00:47:21.154 --> 00:47:22.985
I'm asking you a favor, Myung Hee.

745
00:47:26.994 --> 00:47:29.694
Hee Cafe was open about half a year ago.

746
00:47:29.694 --> 00:47:31.324
And the bakery was open two years ago.

747
00:47:31.324 --> 00:47:32.835
Does that mean I can't evict them from there...

748
00:47:32.835 --> 00:47:34.594
even if I buy those buildings?

749
00:47:34.795 --> 00:47:36.764
Yes. It's the Building Lease Protection Law.

750
00:47:36.764 --> 00:47:39.205
The contract will be automatically succeeded.

751
00:47:40.304 --> 00:47:41.474
Is that so?

752
00:47:41.705 --> 00:47:43.605
(Lessee, Sunwoo Hee)

753
00:47:43.605 --> 00:47:46.045
(Lessee, Kang Nam Goo)

754
00:48:15.375 --> 00:48:17.174
Boss, do we have more orders?

755
00:48:17.174 --> 00:48:18.705
No. We don't have more orders for cutting.

756
00:48:18.705 --> 00:48:20.444
You should assemble the drawer...

757
00:48:20.444 --> 00:48:22.444
and finish the wooden lamp.

758
00:48:22.444 --> 00:48:23.784
I finished it already.

759
00:48:24.884 --> 00:48:26.654
I guess I want to go home early.

760
00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:28.784
Then you should go home now.

761
00:48:28.784 --> 00:48:29.824
Okay.

762
00:48:32.654 --> 00:48:35.194
You're home early. It's not even 5pm yet.

763
00:48:38.525 --> 00:48:40.835
Let's go. I'll take you home.

764
00:48:41.435 --> 00:48:42.634
You have to go.

765
00:48:43.105 --> 00:48:45.335
I can't go today when Ji Soo's here.

766
00:48:45.335 --> 00:48:46.674
I'll stay a few more days.

767
00:48:46.935 --> 00:48:50.205
She's my sister. I'll look after her.

768
00:48:51.145 --> 00:48:53.645
Did something happen?

769
00:48:54.114 --> 00:48:56.244
You told my grandfather you'd move out.

770
00:48:57.415 --> 00:48:59.284
Don't give him anything misunderstandable.

771
00:49:00.315 --> 00:49:01.554
I can't let that happen.

772
00:49:02.054 --> 00:49:03.554
But Ji Soo...

773
00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:06.724
I bought food to last us a few days.

774
00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:09.194
I'll tell her about that.

775
00:49:09.795 --> 00:49:11.165
Others will be home late today.

776
00:49:18.634 --> 00:49:19.875
Hi, Dad.

777
00:49:20.134 --> 00:49:23.545
Ji An, I'd like to meet you.

778
00:49:23.605 --> 00:49:25.205
Are you free after work?

779
00:49:26.215 --> 00:49:30.085
I'll come home today. Can you wait for me there?

780
00:49:42.154 --> 00:49:43.324
Let's take a bus.

781
00:49:43.994 --> 00:49:46.494
The car died on me on the way home.

782
00:49:46.764 --> 00:49:50.134
Did it? I can go on my own. Give me that.

783
00:49:51.304 --> 00:49:54.335
Let me be a big brother for once and get you home.

784
00:50:13.224 --> 00:50:15.594
There are a lot of people on this bus.

785
00:50:16.324 --> 00:50:17.764
It's the evening rush hour.

786
00:50:40.585 --> 00:50:43.884
I can't believe I'm back in this neighborhood.

787
00:50:44.554 --> 00:50:47.094
I said I'd be an animal if I came back here.

788
00:50:47.824 --> 00:50:49.824
I know. Why are you back?

789
00:50:49.864 --> 00:50:52.165
You said you'd never see me again.

790
00:50:52.165 --> 00:50:54.094
You said you were sick of me.

791
00:50:54.795 --> 00:50:56.335
My dad told me...

792
00:50:56.665 --> 00:50:59.134
that I should never say never.

793
00:50:59.735 --> 00:51:01.235
It was understandable then.

794
00:51:01.904 --> 00:51:05.045
You said you were sick of my stubbornness, right?

795
00:51:06.375 --> 00:51:07.775
Did you hear that back then?

796
00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:11.185
- You really said that? - Yes.

797
00:51:15.284 --> 00:51:16.284
It was here.

798
00:51:30.904 --> 00:51:32.264
She'll catch me?

799
00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:40.074
You took your time.

800
00:51:40.415 --> 00:51:41.614
How were you so fast?

801
00:51:41.614 --> 00:51:42.985
I live here.

802
00:51:45.485 --> 00:51:46.955
My goodness.

803
00:51:47.654 --> 00:51:48.855
Is this the police?

804
00:51:50.025 --> 00:51:52.955
Come to Hwanhee Church in Daebang-dong.

805
00:51:52.955 --> 00:51:55.755
Fine, I'll take it, okay?

806
00:51:58.395 --> 00:51:59.994
No wonder you were sick of me.

807
00:52:00.165 --> 00:52:01.634
That wasn't all.

808
00:52:02.264 --> 00:52:05.134
After you left, and stepped on dog poop...

809
00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:06.574
while I was trying to find my keys.

810
00:52:07.074 --> 00:52:08.304
Really?

811
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:11.304
The smell as I drove home was just...

812
00:52:12.744 --> 00:52:14.815
I made you experience so much.

813
00:52:15.145 --> 00:52:16.145
You did.

814
00:52:17.185 --> 00:52:19.915
I had a lot of fun since we met over the accident.

815
00:52:21.955 --> 00:52:25.824
I'd had a stable, rich, monotonous life,

816
00:52:26.255 --> 00:52:27.994
but those were things...

817
00:52:28.694 --> 00:52:31.094
I haven't experienced, felt, or been through.

818
00:52:32.565 --> 00:52:33.764
It was entertaining.

819
00:52:34.835 --> 00:52:37.364
I hope you have more good memories than bad.

820
00:52:39.634 --> 00:52:40.775
Back then,

821
00:52:41.735 --> 00:52:46.014
I didn't know they'd all become things I'd miss.

822
00:52:52.114 --> 00:52:53.985
Isn't your favorite convenience store here?

823
00:52:54.685 --> 00:52:55.755
Of course.

824
00:52:56.724 --> 00:53:00.355
I'm thirsty. How about a farewell beer?

825
00:53:16.174 --> 00:53:18.875
Isn't it an excuse to say they're cheaper in fours?

826
00:53:19.974 --> 00:53:21.014
You alcoholic.

827
00:53:21.645 --> 00:53:24.884
I usually drink 2 and take 2 home.

828
00:53:25.844 --> 00:53:28.685
Today, drink at my speed.

829
00:53:30.424 --> 00:53:31.455
I'll do that.

830
00:53:57.344 --> 00:53:58.645
Let's go now.

831
00:53:59.554 --> 00:54:02.855
The cold beer froze me from the inside.

832
00:54:03.255 --> 00:54:04.424
Do you feel cold?

833
00:54:04.455 --> 00:54:07.054
Yes. I think I need a hot cup of coffee.

834
00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:38.755
We're handing these out for free as a promotion.

835
00:54:38.755 --> 00:54:40.594
Since I haven't seen you in a while.

836
00:54:40.594 --> 00:54:42.224
Gosh, thank you.

837
00:54:45.465 --> 00:54:47.494
Do you eat steamed buns?

838
00:54:47.594 --> 00:54:50.235
Of course. I can never have enough.

839
00:54:52.034 --> 00:54:53.074
Then...

840
00:54:53.935 --> 00:54:55.404
shall we eat them now?

841
00:54:55.404 --> 00:54:58.275
We must. We can't refuse one's generosity.

842
00:55:10.384 --> 00:55:11.855
- It's good. - It's good.

843
00:57:01.764 --> 00:57:04.005
This is it. I'll take that now.

844
00:57:10.944 --> 00:57:12.375
No matter how slow we walked,

845
00:57:13.344 --> 00:57:14.375
we still got here.

846
00:57:17.744 --> 00:57:18.884
I enjoyed...

847
00:57:20.185 --> 00:57:21.884
living with you...

848
00:57:22.284 --> 00:57:23.455
for the last month.

849
00:57:26.295 --> 00:57:27.494
Me too.

850
00:57:30.694 --> 00:57:31.795
Seo Ji An.

851
00:57:32.665 --> 00:57:33.665
Do you know...

852
00:57:34.494 --> 00:57:37.565
why I shouldn't stop you?

853
00:57:40.375 --> 00:57:41.375
It's because...

854
00:57:42.645 --> 00:57:44.545
you can't smile around me.

855
00:57:46.915 --> 00:57:48.715
You smile around Hyuk...

856
00:57:49.545 --> 00:57:51.485
and around Yong Gook.

857
00:57:53.255 --> 00:57:55.485
You smile like yourself...

858
00:57:56.054 --> 00:57:57.455
even around the carpenter...

859
00:57:58.384 --> 00:58:00.154
or our other housemates,

860
00:58:03.025 --> 00:58:04.364
but you can't smile around me.

861
00:58:13.404 --> 00:58:14.505
That's why...

862
00:58:15.634 --> 00:58:17.105
I won't ever stop you.

863
00:58:23.784 --> 00:58:26.985
Don't do it. I hate it when you force a smile.

864
00:58:28.384 --> 00:58:29.924
But it's not forced.

865
00:58:34.755 --> 00:58:35.755
Bye.

866
00:58:36.764 --> 00:58:38.125
Take care, Ji An.

867
00:59:21.435 --> 00:59:22.804
I'm home.

868
00:59:25.174 --> 00:59:26.415
My goodness, Ji An.

869
00:59:28.014 --> 00:59:30.545
Don't tell Ji An what the chairman did.

870
00:59:30.545 --> 00:59:31.614
Don't you dare.

871
00:59:33.715 --> 00:59:35.185
What's the suitcase for?

872
00:59:35.485 --> 00:59:37.424
Mom, Dad.

873
00:59:37.585 --> 00:59:39.824
I'm moving back in. I'm living with you again.

874
00:59:54.304 --> 00:59:56.505
- Dad. - Can I come in?

875
00:59:56.505 --> 00:59:58.804
The door's open. Why even ask?

876
01:00:02.344 --> 01:00:04.685
Do you want to know about Ji Soo?

877
01:00:05.284 --> 01:00:07.685
That's one thing,

878
01:00:07.884 --> 01:00:09.054
but before that,

879
01:00:09.525 --> 01:00:12.025
Haesung's chairman, Chairman No, came by.

880
01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:15.125
To look for Ji Soo?

881
01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:18.025
No, he came because of you.

882
01:00:20.594 --> 01:00:23.505
I know how responsible you are,

883
01:00:23.505 --> 01:00:26.275
so I wouldn't normally say anything else, but...

884
01:00:26.275 --> 01:00:27.935
Did something happen?

885
01:00:27.935 --> 01:00:30.375
Was he abusive towards you or Mom?

886
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:32.404
Not at all.

887
01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.344
He was just worried about his grandson.

888
01:00:36.815 --> 01:00:37.915
He seems to have...

889
01:00:38.944 --> 01:00:41.585
the wrong idea about you and his grandson.

890
01:00:42.315 --> 01:00:43.855
He does have the wrong idea.

891
01:00:45.855 --> 01:00:47.554
Is that so?

892
01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:50.395
But Dad.

893
01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:55.034
To be honest, I do like him.

894
01:00:57.304 --> 01:00:58.335
Do you?

895
01:01:00.735 --> 01:01:03.605
I can't control how I feel,

896
01:01:03.804 --> 01:01:05.574
so I grew to like him,

897
01:01:06.614 --> 01:01:08.344
but we aren't dating.

898
01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:09.415
He knows too.

899
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.815
That's why he gave up on me too.

900
01:01:11.815 --> 01:01:13.485
Since I'm back home now,

901
01:01:13.485 --> 01:01:15.215
we won't meet again anyway.

902
01:01:17.384 --> 01:01:19.955
Yesterday, he helped get Ji Soo back.

903
01:01:19.955 --> 01:01:22.154
We couldn't let her be forced to go abroad.

904
01:01:23.395 --> 01:01:25.935
Maybe that's why he got the wrong idea.

905
01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:28.465
I told him that's not true before.

906
01:01:29.194 --> 01:01:32.465
Did you stop Ji Soo from going abroad?

907
01:01:34.404 --> 01:01:36.304
Did he not mention that?

908
01:01:38.045 --> 01:01:39.444
It's a long story.

909
01:01:39.444 --> 01:01:41.545
I'll tell you everything. Sit down, Dad.

910
01:01:41.545 --> 01:01:43.014
No, don't bother.

911
01:01:43.944 --> 01:01:44.944
What?

912
01:01:45.485 --> 01:01:47.284
Don't bother telling me...

913
01:01:47.284 --> 01:01:49.154
your painful past.

914
01:01:50.384 --> 01:01:52.755
Why not? I'm so relieved now.

915
01:01:53.295 --> 01:01:54.594
Did Ji Soo...

916
01:01:55.824 --> 01:01:58.094
do something she can live with?

917
01:02:00.364 --> 01:02:02.465
I believe so.

918
01:02:03.404 --> 01:02:04.935
We'll visit one day.

919
01:02:04.935 --> 01:02:06.875
You can go back and rest in Jeongseon.

920
01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:09.775
Spend a month doing whatever you want to do.

921
01:02:16.685 --> 01:02:19.654
Ji An went to Daebang-dong for a few days?

922
01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:20.815
Why?

923
01:02:21.514 --> 01:02:24.125
She got caught being with me while getting you.

924
01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:27.455
I was afraid our mom would come over,

925
01:02:28.054 --> 01:02:29.724
so I sent her home.

926
01:02:38.235 --> 01:02:40.705
It's great walking to work with you.

927
01:02:41.074 --> 01:02:43.705
I like it too, but isn't your hand freezing?

928
01:02:43.775 --> 01:02:46.014
What? No, it's not.

929
01:02:46.275 --> 01:02:47.645
Mine is.

930
01:02:50.244 --> 01:02:51.415
Let's do this.

931
01:02:52.715 --> 01:02:53.755
Okay.

932
01:02:55.215 --> 01:02:56.525
- Is it warm? - Yes.

933
01:02:56.525 --> 01:02:58.554
It is since it's in your hand and pocket.

934
01:02:58.554 --> 01:03:00.755
You said it wasn't freezing earlier.

935
01:03:11.634 --> 01:03:13.634
Is someone buying the building?

936
01:03:13.634 --> 01:03:16.944
Well, this lady seems to like it a lot.

937
01:03:17.574 --> 01:03:19.174
She'll pay double the market price.

938
01:03:26.384 --> 01:03:27.855
Mr. Baker.

939
01:03:27.955 --> 01:03:30.625
Nam Goo, Ji Soo is back.

940
01:03:37.165 --> 01:03:38.525
Ms. Min...

941
01:03:40.935 --> 01:03:44.534
(Haesung FNB Manager Replacements)

942
01:03:45.205 --> 01:03:47.705
Why was the Sinchon branch have its manager replaced?

943
01:03:47.705 --> 01:03:49.574
It was Ms. No's orders, sir.

944
01:03:54.674 --> 01:03:55.915
You may leave.

945
01:04:09.094 --> 01:04:10.795
(Ji Soo's temporary number)

946
01:04:13.094 --> 01:04:14.295
Hi, Ji Soo.

947
01:04:42.824 --> 01:04:44.165
Ji Soo saw you?

948
01:04:45.224 --> 01:04:46.465
Good.

949
01:04:48.295 --> 01:04:49.634
I'll call again later.

950
01:04:51.605 --> 01:04:52.674
Did you buy...

951
01:04:53.074 --> 01:04:55.474
the building Sunwoo Hyuk's family lives in?

952
01:04:56.205 --> 01:04:58.775
It was an empty threat when I told Ji Soo,

953
01:04:58.775 --> 01:05:01.045
but she didn't listen, so I took action.

954
01:05:03.014 --> 01:05:05.715
I told you that I can't give up on her.

955
01:05:05.715 --> 01:05:07.355
I can't let her be like that.

956
01:05:07.355 --> 01:05:09.525
And you forced Yang Mi Jung to quit too?

957
01:05:09.924 --> 01:05:12.924
That was my warning to Seo Ji An.

958
01:05:12.924 --> 01:05:14.395
Yang Mi Jung saved...

959
01:05:15.455 --> 01:05:17.065
our daughter's life.

960
01:05:17.065 --> 01:05:18.465
Stop being so unreasonable.

961
01:05:18.465 --> 01:05:19.494
That night,

962
01:05:20.494 --> 01:05:22.605
that bridge got washed away in a storm.

963
01:05:23.205 --> 01:05:25.105
If Seo Tae Soo hadn't found her,

964
01:05:25.105 --> 01:05:27.775
Eun Seok would've gotten washed away and died.

965
01:05:28.605 --> 01:05:31.275
Jo Soon Ok left her there and didn't watch her.

966
01:05:32.105 --> 01:05:33.645
What do you mean?

967
01:05:34.114 --> 01:05:36.244
Jo Soon Ok didn't watch her?

968
01:05:37.444 --> 01:05:39.114
How do you know that?

969
01:05:39.114 --> 01:05:41.085
But you think Ji Soo isn't good enough?

970
01:05:41.215 --> 01:05:42.685
She isn't educated enough?

971
01:05:43.154 --> 01:05:45.224
She isn't good enough for our family?

972
01:05:45.224 --> 01:05:46.855
That's what you think.

973
01:05:47.494 --> 01:05:49.264
You think our Ji Soo...

974
01:05:49.665 --> 01:05:51.594
lacks class and elegance.

975
01:05:51.594 --> 01:05:53.835
Tell me about Jo Soon Ok first.

976
01:05:56.105 --> 01:05:58.205
Are you the one who smuggled her away?

977
01:05:58.205 --> 01:05:59.335
You...

978
01:06:00.634 --> 01:06:02.304
No Myung Hee, you...

979
01:06:03.404 --> 01:06:06.275
You believe you're so classy and elegant,

980
01:06:06.275 --> 01:06:07.744
but you, Myung Hee...

981
01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:11.884
You lost our daughter...

982
01:06:12.415 --> 01:06:13.815
while going to meet another man.

983
01:06:14.485 --> 01:06:15.715
You lost Eun Seok.
