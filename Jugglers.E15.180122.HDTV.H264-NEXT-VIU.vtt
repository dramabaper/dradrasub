(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:09.507
The departments being considered...

4
00:00:09.578 --> 00:00:11.077
for reorganization are as follows.

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:11.706
Yes.

6
00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:14.148
Okay. To start off,

7
00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:16.347
Digital Marketing,

8
00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.187
Promotion,

9
00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.788
Finance two,

10
00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:21.588
and Accounting two.

11
00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.257
(YB Ads Candidates for Dissolution)

12
00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.358
And finally, the department...

13
00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:29.867
being considered for dissolution...

14
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.068
is the video department.

15
00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:50.218
The factors considered are adequacy,

16
00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.987
professionalism, integrity, performance.

17
00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.687
Each element will be held equally important...

18
00:00:56.727 --> 00:00:58.028
and judged accordingly.

19
00:00:58.028 --> 00:00:59.627
We plan to decide...

20
00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.657
by the end of the month.

21
00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.968
If there's nothing else, let's end the meeting...

22
00:01:09.597 --> 00:01:10.968
Yes, Mr. Nam?

23
00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.478
For departments...

24
00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:24.047
who survive the evaluation this month,

25
00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:28.487
may the department head get full authority...

26
00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:31.888
over personnel assignments?

27
00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:36.097
Well...

28
00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:38.797
If you can survive,

29
00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:40.998
sure, we'll give you that.

30
00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:43.937
Naturally.

31
00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:00.758
Were you okay?

32
00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:02.558
Do you want me to ask my uncle...

33
00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:04.528
Focus on your own department.

34
00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:09.258
- Sir. - Yes?

35
00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.867
- I'll hold the elevator. - Wait.

36
00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:18.408
Why would you give him such authority?

37
00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:19.837
Sir?

38
00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:23.408
I think he's a little crazy.

39
00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:27.117
I've had enough. Hold this.

40
00:02:27.777 --> 00:02:29.318
Why do you keep on talking casually to me?

41
00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:30.948
Well?

42
00:02:31.288 --> 00:02:34.188
Mr. Nam, HR just called.

43
00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:35.717
They found Yoon Yi's replacement.

44
00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:37.728
- So... - No, forget it.

45
00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.358
Pardon?

46
00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:43.427
I'll...

47
00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:46.538
leave that seat empty until the owner returns.

48
00:02:47.237 --> 00:02:49.397
I'll talk to HR myself.

49
00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:51.367
Okay.

50
00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:26.367
I don't want someone else to sit at your seat.

51
00:03:56.568 --> 00:04:02.307
(This Seat Will Always Be Yours)

52
00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:10.647
Mr. Nitpick,

53
00:04:10.818 --> 00:04:12.888
rescue me from the villain.

54
00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:14.117
I'll be waiting.

55
00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:27.868
(You could be a cartoonist.)

56
00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.298
You could be a cartoonist.

57
00:04:29.638 --> 00:04:30.707
You have talent.

58
00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:35.808
(Misery)

59
00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:36.878
Misery?

60
00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:39.308
(Misery)

61
00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:40.977
What now? No.

62
00:04:44.647 --> 00:04:45.647
Hey.

63
00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:47.957
I'm going out for lunch.

64
00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:48.957
Okay.

65
00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:52.188
Also, my wife will start calling again.

66
00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:54.357
Don't worry.

67
00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:56.258
I told her there is nothing between us.

68
00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.068
She won't misunderstand.

69
00:04:58.928 --> 00:04:59.998
It would have been nice...

70
00:05:00.397 --> 00:05:03.568
if you told her when the incident occurred.

71
00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:07.808
Anyway, you can deal with her yourself.

72
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:08.808
It's your specialty.

73
00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:12.678
What's wrong with... Turn around.

74
00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:14.048
- Pardon? - Turn around.

75
00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:19.017
Don't you have heels that are slimmer?

76
00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:20.618
Well...

77
00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.188
They make loud clacking sounds.

78
00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.388
Who cares about the sound?

79
00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:25.857
How you look is more important.

80
00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:27.328
Change them right now.

81
00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:30.767
Are you ignoring me again?

82
00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:33.097
Is this what Chi Won taught you?

83
00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:35.868
I'll change them.

84
00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:39.008
Yes, Mi Sun. I'm coming.

85
00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:42.308
- Yes. - That filthy player.

86
00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.378
I wish he would get caught.

87
00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:51.048
(Misery)

88
00:05:53.147 --> 00:05:54.457
Hello, ma'am.

89
00:05:56.988 --> 00:05:58.688
Have you been well?

90
00:06:02.298 --> 00:06:06.027
(Director Hwangbo Yool)

91
00:06:06.027 --> 00:06:07.897
Why hasn't she replied?

92
00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:09.167
(When are you coming back?)

93
00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.238
I only meant she should take a break.

94
00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.238
(Are you sick?)

95
00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.638
She's taking too long.

96
00:06:13.638 --> 00:06:16.008
(Should I come to you?)

97
00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:27.758
Mr. Hwangbo.

98
00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.628
I'm not sure if you'll like it,

99
00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:31.758
but try some.

100
00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.397
I'll have this first.

101
00:06:37.568 --> 00:06:38.628
It's good.

102
00:06:39.368 --> 00:06:41.097
It's delicious.

103
00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:43.368
He asked not to act on your own,

104
00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:46.808
and that you just do what you're told.

105
00:06:46.808 --> 00:06:48.337
How can anyone...

106
00:06:50.178 --> 00:06:52.707
only do what they're told?

107
00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:57.118
Can't someone live while doing...

108
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.347
what they like and what they want?

109
00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:01.058
What?

110
00:07:13.498 --> 00:07:16.138
If you cry this sadly,

111
00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:19.707
it would hurt your mom even more.

112
00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:22.477
Let's cry just until today.

113
00:07:23.037 --> 00:07:25.178
Starting tomorrow, you can be strong again.

114
00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:43.897
(Congratulations! Ms. Wang's 100th day!)

115
00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:52.407
Her 100th day is coming soon.

116
00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:55.977
I thought she would be the first assistant...

117
00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:59.008
to last 100 days.

118
00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:04.048
Mi Ae is absent without notice for way too long.

119
00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:06.388
I guess she has enough to live on without a job.

120
00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:10.688
I can't quit even when I want to...

121
00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:12.628
because of the money.

122
00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:14.758
She's not absent without notice.

123
00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:16.527
Mr. Hwangbo told her to take a break.

124
00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:19.027
He's only bullying her.

125
00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:21.238
He was so mean to her just before.

126
00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:22.837
I feel bad for her.

127
00:08:28.578 --> 00:08:31.078
Mr. Hwangbo, when will we have the meeting?

128
00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.127
(YB Ads Candidates for Dissolution)

129
00:08:57.438 --> 00:08:58.808
- Sir. - Yes?

130
00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:01.178
The program made by the video department...

131
00:09:01.178 --> 00:09:02.737
is scheduled to air for next week.

132
00:09:02.737 --> 00:09:04.648
- What? - They're focusing...

133
00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:06.648
the story on issues in our department.

134
00:09:06.648 --> 00:09:09.918
It looks like they are able to get interviews.

135
00:09:09.918 --> 00:09:12.288
Are you serious?

136
00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:15.058
How dare he try to attack me?

137
00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.097
Hey.

138
00:09:24.727 --> 00:09:25.727
Hello.

139
00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:39.448
That's my cactus. Can you be more careful?

140
00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:52.727
What is it?

141
00:09:52.857 --> 00:09:54.428
I have a meeting to go to.

142
00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:56.898
Nam Chi Won.

143
00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:01.568
You stinky rats!

144
00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:04.438
What?

145
00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.007
Reshuffling?

146
00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:08.278
Let's say you're lucky...

147
00:10:08.278 --> 00:10:10.007
and you manage to avoid getting fired.

148
00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:11.477
But the moment I become the vice president,

149
00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:14.377
all of you are getting cut.

150
00:10:14.717 --> 00:10:18.418
You're all done for by the end of the month!

151
00:10:19.247 --> 00:10:21.158
You should worry about your own future...

152
00:10:21.357 --> 00:10:23.257
before worrying about my team members.

153
00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:25.928
Are you accusing me of unfair work distribution?

154
00:10:26.127 --> 00:10:28.997
Hey, do you have evidence? Do you?

155
00:10:28.997 --> 00:10:31.898
Interviews of people talking nonsense...

156
00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:33.737
shouldn't be aired if you don't have evidence.

157
00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:35.938
Go ahead.

158
00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:39.467
I'll sue you for defamation!

159
00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:42.207
If we're on that topic, I have a lot to say.

160
00:10:42.938 --> 00:10:43.948
Well,

161
00:10:44.548 --> 00:10:46.948
if you find a good lawyer, please recommend me.

162
00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:49.887
Is that so?

163
00:10:50.347 --> 00:10:51.418
Fine.

164
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.587
If that's what you want,

165
00:10:54.288 --> 00:10:56.018
we can fight on top of the cliff.

166
00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.028
One of us will fall at some point.

167
00:11:01.597 --> 00:11:02.727
Cho Sang Moo.

168
00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:04.127
- What? - Mr. Cho.

169
00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:08.538
You better be on your toes.

170
00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:11.808
Then.

171
00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:15.038
- Let's go. - Go.

172
00:11:18.148 --> 00:11:21.117
You scumbag!

173
00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.158
We can't air with this.

174
00:11:32.957 --> 00:11:34.898
The interview questions are too vague.

175
00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:38.597
There isn't much picture to put together.

176
00:11:38.727 --> 00:11:40.597
At this rate, we can't air at all.

177
00:11:42.737 --> 00:11:45.207
The thing is,

178
00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:49.507
I think they blocked my number.

179
00:11:49.778 --> 00:11:50.908
I can't get through.

180
00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:52.707
Is your phone the only way you get work done?

181
00:11:53.977 --> 00:11:55.448
Don't you have feet?

182
00:11:55.678 --> 00:11:57.018
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:58.247 --> 00:12:00.717
What about the retirees from Ad Planning?

184
00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:04.387
We're still confirming their addresses.

185
00:12:04.387 --> 00:12:06.328
You haven't figured out where they are yet?

186
00:12:08.097 --> 00:12:09.298
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:19.908
We only have a few days until the broadcast.

188
00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:23.507
Wake up,

189
00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:25.847
and speed it up.

190
00:12:25.847 --> 00:12:27.518
- Okay. - Okay.

191
00:12:33.757 --> 00:12:35.757
It's so chilly.

192
00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:40.597
He was in a bad mood, and Cutter made it worse.

193
00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.957
We're dead meat.

194
00:12:43.097 --> 00:12:46.398
It feels like Mr. Nam is back to his old self.

195
00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.867
Is it because Yoon Yi is not here?

196
00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:52.408
Let's get moving.

197
00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:09.387
Mr. Nam,

198
00:13:10.227 --> 00:13:11.457
have some coffee.

199
00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:17.867
Mr. Nam always drinks this coffee...

200
00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.068
at 11am and 2pm.

201
00:13:22.837 --> 00:13:26.237
Make sure you use boiling water.

202
00:13:43.727 --> 00:13:46.288
I got a blister from sharpening the pencils.

203
00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:53.438
He needs 10 pencils per day.

204
00:13:53.597 --> 00:13:55.798
Make sure the lead is longer than 0.5cm.

205
00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:58.207
You must make the end very sharp.

206
00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:03.678
Also, he hates it when I use the machine.

207
00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:06.048
You have to sharpen it by hand every morning.

208
00:14:15.257 --> 00:14:18.058
Mr. Nam, I'll tell you your schedule for today.

209
00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:20.627
At 11:30am, Mr. Kim Young Seok...

210
00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:24.298
will be coming here for your meeting.

211
00:14:24.398 --> 00:14:25.497
At 2:30pm...

212
00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:28.168
Also, please remind him of his schedule...

213
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.837
once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

214
00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:34.637
Every now and then, he confuses his schedule.

215
00:14:34.778 --> 00:14:36.408
- I'll show it to you. - Okay.

216
00:14:46.188 --> 00:14:49.058
I still need you.

217
00:14:54.497 --> 00:14:56.257
During the reshuffling,

218
00:14:56.398 --> 00:14:59.068
please do your best to get rid of...

219
00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:00.938
Nam Chi Won and the video department.

220
00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:02.837
I'll see about that.

221
00:15:03.308 --> 00:15:04.867
Pour me a glass.

222
00:15:05.207 --> 00:15:06.308
Sure.

223
00:15:07.737 --> 00:15:10.648
When I become the vice president,

224
00:15:10.908 --> 00:15:14.418
I'll return the favor to you.

225
00:15:15.578 --> 00:15:18.587
You're trying so hard.

226
00:15:22.117 --> 00:15:23.257
What?

227
00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:26.597
Hey. Gosh.

228
00:15:26.997 --> 00:15:28.627
It's still flapping.

229
00:15:28.997 --> 00:15:30.428
It's trying so hard.

230
00:15:34.698 --> 00:15:36.337
About that vice president position...

231
00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:39.768
Someone from the head office could come.

232
00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:41.678
You should watch what you eat,

233
00:15:44.507 --> 00:15:45.977
or you could get sick.

234
00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:51.617
Has it been 25 years since you started work?

235
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.148
- No, 26. - I see.

236
00:15:53.457 --> 00:15:55.357
If we're talking about that,

237
00:15:55.457 --> 00:15:58.288
I started way before you did.

238
00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.528
Let's see.

239
00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:04.127
You got hired out of a technical high school.

240
00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:06.568
You didn't go to college?

241
00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.668
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

242
00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.308
I respect people who advance without education.

243
00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:14.377
Here, have a glass.

244
00:16:14.377 --> 00:16:17.308
- It's okay to have it. - Okay.

245
00:16:20.217 --> 00:16:22.448
I'll give you one too.

246
00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:26.117
You have so much love for humanity.

247
00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:27.987
I admire you.

248
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.227
- Gosh. - I can't understand...

249
00:16:30.227 --> 00:16:33.257
how you can love several women at once.

250
00:16:33.528 --> 00:16:35.257
It's really amazing.

251
00:16:36.198 --> 00:16:37.828
You're amazing.

252
00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:40.768
- What did you say? - That's right.

253
00:16:41.398 --> 00:16:42.467
Come at me.

254
00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:03.528
Do a background check on Bong Jang Woo.

255
00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.657
There was that scandal with Jwa Yoon Yi.

256
00:17:08.097 --> 00:17:11.397
I'm sure he has women problems.

257
00:17:15.097 --> 00:17:16.298
While we're at it,

258
00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:20.177
I need to be the one deciding who gets cut.

259
00:18:02.518 --> 00:18:05.518
The number you're calling is turned off.

260
00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:07.617
You will be connected to voicemail.

261
00:18:07.818 --> 00:18:09.258
After you're connected...

262
00:18:25.808 --> 00:18:26.907
Hello?

263
00:18:27.377 --> 00:18:28.437
T-Rex.

264
00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:32.147
(Wang Mi Ae)

265
00:18:40.117 --> 00:18:41.258
Mom.

266
00:18:44.488 --> 00:18:45.587
Mr. Hwangbo.

267
00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:53.197
What a cozy place.

268
00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.637
Since you live here,

269
00:18:55.798 --> 00:18:57.867
this must be a palace.

270
00:19:03.038 --> 00:19:05.907
I bought you ribs. Have it with your son.

271
00:19:07.278 --> 00:19:08.518
Thank you.

272
00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:12.947
By the way, when are you coming back?

273
00:19:13.657 --> 00:19:15.417
I'm tired of waiting.

274
00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:18.558
Sir, I won't be going back.

275
00:19:19.127 --> 00:19:20.498
No, I can't.

276
00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:27.637
Ms. Wang.

277
00:19:28.498 --> 00:19:30.808
I don't deserve to be called like that.

278
00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:34.478
Like you said, I was a fake.

279
00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:37.947
This is my real identity. Jung Ae, the housewife.

280
00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:41.048
I'm going to go back to being a mom.

281
00:19:41.117 --> 00:19:43.818
What about me? Are you throwing me away?

282
00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:46.218
What about our e-sports business?

283
00:19:46.288 --> 00:19:48.117
You wanted to create a youth team.

284
00:19:48.117 --> 00:19:51.488
You pitched the idea. You can't leave midway.

285
00:19:52.127 --> 00:19:54.558
I won't allow it. I won't process your resignation.

286
00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.968
I don't care.

287
00:19:57.867 --> 00:19:59.127
Mr. Hwangbo.

288
00:19:59.328 --> 00:20:02.397
If you won't come to work, I'll stay here.

289
00:20:02.798 --> 00:20:06.068
I'll tell them to bring all the reports here.

290
00:20:11.347 --> 00:20:12.907
Hello? Mr. Baek.

291
00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:15.117
Please. What's wrong with you?

292
00:20:15.117 --> 00:20:17.917
- It's me. I'm at... - I'll leave, then.

293
00:20:20.857 --> 00:20:22.417
Ms. Wang! Wait!

294
00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:26.958
I got it. I got it.

295
00:20:27.097 --> 00:20:29.097
I'll leave. Happy?

296
00:20:32.768 --> 00:20:34.298
You're pretty stubborn.

297
00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:36.568
How about this?

298
00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:39.137
Stay until your 100th day.

299
00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.837
It's your 100th day soon.

300
00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.778
Just until then. Please?

301
00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:46.978
- But... - I never had anyone...

302
00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.447
last for 100 days as my assistant.

303
00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.657
Ms. Wang.

304
00:20:58.627 --> 00:21:00.758
If you leave too,

305
00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:05.397
I don't think I'll ever have anyone on my side.

306
00:21:52.508 --> 00:21:53.578
Sir.

307
00:21:59.248 --> 00:22:00.657
Have some coffee.

308
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:11.197
They can see from outside.

309
00:22:11.427 --> 00:22:13.597
Who cares? It's just a dream anyway.

310
00:22:17.738 --> 00:22:19.107
It isn't a dream.

311
00:22:22.177 --> 00:22:23.978
How are you in here?

312
00:22:24.107 --> 00:22:26.947
Mr. Bong left early today.

313
00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:31.617
You look like you've gotten taller.

314
00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:33.857
I'm wearing heels.

315
00:22:35.058 --> 00:22:36.687
I haven't worn heels in a while,

316
00:22:36.687 --> 00:22:38.458
so they're really uncomfortable.

317
00:22:38.828 --> 00:22:40.258
I don't know...

318
00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:42.528
how I used to run around in them before.

319
00:22:44.298 --> 00:22:45.897
I'll have to make you put on the shoes...

320
00:22:46.427 --> 00:22:48.038
I bought you and come back to me soon.

321
00:22:59.447 --> 00:23:00.617
Wang Jung Ae?

322
00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:19.728
The legal department will take action soon.

323
00:23:20.068 --> 00:23:21.538
We wanted to bury...

324
00:23:22.137 --> 00:23:23.308
your faking your identity,

325
00:23:23.308 --> 00:23:25.538
but Yool keeps blowing things up.

326
00:23:26.877 --> 00:23:29.377
He's an immature child. He can't protect you.

327
00:23:30.048 --> 00:23:33.847
So you should choose wisely yourself.

328
00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:37.617
Get out.

329
00:23:55.697 --> 00:23:57.738
Don't you dare do this again.

330
00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:01.107
She's my assistant. I make the decisions.

331
00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:03.008
No,

332
00:24:03.248 --> 00:24:05.308
you cannot do anything...

333
00:24:05.308 --> 00:24:07.018
without the elders' permission.

334
00:24:07.018 --> 00:24:08.018
Really?

335
00:24:08.748 --> 00:24:10.887
Then I'll just do as I please from now on.

336
00:24:11.018 --> 00:24:12.518
Go and tell them,

337
00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:14.958
that I'll choose my own assistant,

338
00:24:15.117 --> 00:24:17.488
and do whatever business I want!

339
00:24:18.988 --> 00:24:21.558
You'll regret it.

340
00:24:22.458 --> 00:24:23.927
I won't regret it,

341
00:24:24.167 --> 00:24:26.197
so don't show your face again.

342
00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:29.937
Okay, then. I'll relay exactly what you said.

343
00:24:45.587 --> 00:24:46.657
Sir.

344
00:24:47.657 --> 00:24:50.258
I don't think I can do it.

345
00:24:50.528 --> 00:24:52.187
I can't return to work.

346
00:24:52.828 --> 00:24:53.828
Ms. Wang.

347
00:24:55.558 --> 00:24:57.268
Please trust me just once.

348
00:24:57.828 --> 00:24:59.298
I'll protect you...

349
00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.937
and make this project a success.

350
00:25:03.937 --> 00:25:05.008
So...

351
00:25:07.107 --> 00:25:08.278
trust me...

352
00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:10.308
and come back.

353
00:25:24.828 --> 00:25:27.958
Yoon Yi. Let's have dinner.

354
00:25:32.768 --> 00:25:33.837
Do you think he'll go?

355
00:25:34.167 --> 00:25:35.937
I think you should ask.

356
00:25:35.937 --> 00:25:37.208
No, no.

357
00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:39.068
- Yes. - No.

358
00:25:39.068 --> 00:25:40.837
- You should go. - No, no.

359
00:25:40.837 --> 00:25:41.937
You should go.

360
00:25:41.937 --> 00:25:43.038
You should go.

361
00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:44.708
- No. - You go.

362
00:25:49.318 --> 00:25:50.318
What is it?

363
00:25:51.518 --> 00:25:53.857
Well... Sir...

364
00:25:53.857 --> 00:25:55.258
I'm not eating dinner.

365
00:25:55.288 --> 00:25:56.357
You can go.

366
00:25:57.087 --> 00:25:59.127
No, that's not it.

367
00:26:01.558 --> 00:26:03.728
You've been pulling...

368
00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:05.597
all-nighters lately.

369
00:26:05.828 --> 00:26:08.768
You've been under a lot of stress,

370
00:26:11.038 --> 00:26:13.907
so how about some pork belly and soju?

371
00:26:14.278 --> 00:26:16.548
Is this the time for pork belly and soju?

372
00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:18.407
Exactly, I agree. So...

373
00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:21.647
Yes, it is the time for pork belly and soju!

374
00:26:21.647 --> 00:26:22.677
This is the time!

375
00:26:22.677 --> 00:26:24.218
Right now! Let's go.

376
00:26:25.187 --> 00:26:26.518
Don't you know the situation...

377
00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:27.558
Arrest him!

378
00:26:28.258 --> 00:26:29.258
What the...

379
00:26:29.357 --> 00:26:30.728
- Right now. - Let's go.

380
00:26:30.728 --> 00:26:32.758
- What are you doing? - Let's go!

381
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.197
- Let's go! - What are you doing?

382
00:26:42.597 --> 00:26:46.367
You need to eat up. Eat. Eat.

383
00:26:46.907 --> 00:26:48.837
You like liver. Here.

384
00:26:50.978 --> 00:26:53.647
I feel all stuffed up inside already.

385
00:26:53.718 --> 00:26:56.147
Just looking at that is making it worse.

386
00:27:00.258 --> 00:27:01.857
You said you wanted to talk.

387
00:27:01.857 --> 00:27:02.857
Go ahead.

388
00:27:03.988 --> 00:27:06.357
Yoon Yi. You know,

389
00:27:07.197 --> 00:27:09.558
I'm going to try very hard this time...

390
00:27:09.558 --> 00:27:11.828
so you won't be ashamed of the five years we dated.

391
00:27:11.828 --> 00:27:14.038
I'll bring you back to our department.

392
00:27:14.137 --> 00:27:16.808
You know I always keep my word.

393
00:27:21.008 --> 00:27:23.407
Stop staring. Eat. Eat.

394
00:27:23.847 --> 00:27:26.447
I always felt bad that I only fed you...

395
00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.818
instant noodles when we dated.

396
00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:32.048
Order more. Tonkatsu? Order everything.

397
00:27:34.218 --> 00:27:36.058
I like instant noodles.

398
00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:41.258
Chang Soo.

399
00:27:43.397 --> 00:27:45.268
Keep your promise...

400
00:27:47.437 --> 00:27:48.538
to work hard.

401
00:27:51.907 --> 00:27:54.508
Call me "Sweetie" again. You sound so distant.

402
00:27:55.877 --> 00:27:57.877
You little piece of...

403
00:27:59.078 --> 00:28:00.078
Open up.

404
00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:03.048
With the sauce.

405
00:28:04.818 --> 00:28:07.458
You're so picky.

406
00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.048
Sir.

407
00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:34.847
It's hard because Yoon Yi's gone, isn't it?

408
00:28:37.617 --> 00:28:40.417
- Not particularly. - It's obvious.

409
00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:43.357
You get annoyed with us and scowl again.

410
00:28:43.927 --> 00:28:44.927
When did I do that?

411
00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:47.458
First, drink up.

412
00:28:47.758 --> 00:28:48.828
Drink.

413
00:28:48.897 --> 00:28:50.897
That's good. Yes.

414
00:28:51.328 --> 00:28:52.897
Here you go.

415
00:28:57.738 --> 00:28:59.367
Doesn't it taste good, chewing it?

416
00:29:00.137 --> 00:29:01.607
We came here often...

417
00:29:01.607 --> 00:29:04.548
and badmouthed you a lot.

418
00:29:06.308 --> 00:29:09.018
That helped relieve stress...

419
00:29:09.177 --> 00:29:11.387
and form a sense of solidarity.

420
00:29:11.687 --> 00:29:12.687
You know,

421
00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:16.058
there needs to be a common enemy.

422
00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.228
It makes the drinks taste better...

423
00:29:18.228 --> 00:29:20.597
and improve your will to fight.

424
00:29:26.637 --> 00:29:27.697
Sir.

425
00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:31.308
We all have a reason to survive here.

426
00:29:31.308 --> 00:29:33.778
That's why we'll fight with all we've got.

427
00:29:35.478 --> 00:29:37.607
We know you don't like us, and that...

428
00:29:37.607 --> 00:29:39.278
we're not good enough for you,

429
00:29:40.177 --> 00:29:42.078
but don't struggle alone.

430
00:29:42.578 --> 00:29:44.048
Work with us.

431
00:29:44.147 --> 00:29:46.288
Now, take one more shot.

432
00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:47.558
Wait a second.

433
00:29:52.528 --> 00:29:54.627
Let me pour you all a shot.

434
00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:00.097
That sounds good.

435
00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:03.637
Mr. Park Chi Soo.

436
00:30:03.808 --> 00:30:04.808
Yes.

437
00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:09.107
Thank you.

438
00:30:09.778 --> 00:30:10.877
Ms. Moon Soon Young.

439
00:30:12.048 --> 00:30:13.578
Yes, sir.

440
00:30:16.117 --> 00:30:17.187
Mr. Gong Yoo.

441
00:30:21.617 --> 00:30:22.617
Hae Jin.

442
00:30:23.117 --> 00:30:24.127
Yes.

443
00:30:26.657 --> 00:30:27.828
And Myung Suk.

444
00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:28.927
Yes.

445
00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:34.837
Okay. Let's toast to our department.

446
00:30:35.697 --> 00:30:38.137
No more worries!

447
00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:39.708
No more sighing!

448
00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:41.538
No more getting annoyed!

449
00:30:41.538 --> 00:30:42.708
No more!

450
00:30:42.837 --> 00:30:45.578
- No more! - No more!

451
00:30:46.478 --> 00:30:48.677
- No more - No more

452
00:30:48.677 --> 00:30:50.447
No more

453
00:30:51.988 --> 00:30:53.958
- No more - No more

454
00:30:53.958 --> 00:30:56.258
- No more nagging - Nagging

455
00:31:01.228 --> 00:31:02.627
I want to wear these...

456
00:31:03.768 --> 00:31:05.798
and go back soon.

457
00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.177
Is he still working?

458
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:32.201
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E15 Jugglers "This Seat Will Always Be Yours"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

459
00:31:41.238 --> 00:31:42.268
Mr. Nam.

460
00:31:44.937 --> 00:31:46.208
Raccoon.

461
00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:49.278
How long were you out here?

462
00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.308
I don't know.

463
00:31:53.847 --> 00:31:57.117
When I woke up, I was here.

464
00:31:58.347 --> 00:32:00.357
Instincts really are...

465
00:32:01.558 --> 00:32:02.788
frightening.

466
00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:09.728
Your hands are freezing. They're like ice.

467
00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.697
You should come in and thaw out.

468
00:32:15.568 --> 00:32:17.238
I should go soon.

469
00:32:18.068 --> 00:32:19.407
If I stay any longer,

470
00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:23.078
I may want to stay.

471
00:32:25.508 --> 00:32:26.877
Is that bad?

472
00:32:27.778 --> 00:32:29.078
Of course.

473
00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:32.288
I need to focus and work,

474
00:32:32.748 --> 00:32:34.417
and fight,

475
00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:37.028
and win. I promised.

476
00:32:38.058 --> 00:32:40.228
If I go in now,

477
00:32:41.697 --> 00:32:44.427
I'll want to play with you instead.

478
00:32:44.427 --> 00:32:46.127
Don't you see that?

479
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:52.038
Hold on.

480
00:32:52.238 --> 00:32:53.778
What?

481
00:32:58.647 --> 00:32:59.877
What is that?

482
00:33:00.677 --> 00:33:02.048
Hold on.

483
00:33:04.788 --> 00:33:06.187
My head...

484
00:33:17.998 --> 00:33:20.068
I saw you grabbing it earlier.

485
00:33:21.038 --> 00:33:23.097
I thought maybe it was all cut up.

486
00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:27.877
If you keep doing this,

487
00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:31.508
I won't want to let you go.

488
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:43.657
Give me a minute.

489
00:33:45.258 --> 00:33:47.228
Let me stay this way for a minute.

490
00:33:53.867 --> 00:33:54.867
So cold.

491
00:33:57.008 --> 00:33:58.238
It's nice.

492
00:34:04.048 --> 00:34:06.778
It's cold. Give me that one too.

493
00:34:08.447 --> 00:34:09.547
How nice.

494
00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:13.987
It's so warm.

495
00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:16.418
You are warm,

496
00:34:17.328 --> 00:34:18.858
Yoon Yi.

497
00:34:39.808 --> 00:34:40.878
Gun Woo.

498
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:46.717
I may...

499
00:34:48.617 --> 00:34:51.628
have to give you less allowance.

500
00:34:52.558 --> 00:34:55.427
But don't get part-time jobs without telling me.

501
00:34:55.757 --> 00:34:58.398
Why? Are you going to quit your job?

502
00:35:00.967 --> 00:35:02.097
I don't know.

503
00:35:02.237 --> 00:35:03.668
Don't worry about me.

504
00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:07.777
Just do what you want to do.

505
00:35:09.378 --> 00:35:11.507
What I want to do?

506
00:35:11.947 --> 00:35:13.007
Yes.

507
00:35:26.797 --> 00:35:28.958
Don't stay up too late.

508
00:35:40.978 --> 00:35:43.108
I said what you asked.

509
00:35:44.047 --> 00:35:45.407
Good job, T-Rex.

510
00:35:45.907 --> 00:35:49.748
(You received a gift.)

511
00:35:51.918 --> 00:35:53.188
Nice.

512
00:35:53.617 --> 00:35:55.588
I did everything I could.

513
00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:08.538
Please, come back, Ms. Wang.

514
00:36:27.717 --> 00:36:28.887
Ms. Wang!

515
00:36:31.588 --> 00:36:33.058
Good morning.

516
00:36:34.328 --> 00:36:36.197
You're really back, right?

517
00:36:37.797 --> 00:36:38.898
Yes.

518
00:36:39.268 --> 00:36:41.597
I'll complete the 100 days.

519
00:36:41.768 --> 00:36:42.838
100 days?

520
00:36:43.507 --> 00:36:45.708
Sure. Okay.

521
00:36:46.507 --> 00:36:47.907
Anyway...

522
00:36:49.578 --> 00:36:51.078
Ta-da!

523
00:36:53.317 --> 00:36:56.047
Work as Wang Jung Ae now instead of Wang Mi Ae.

524
00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.317
I got it made for you.

525
00:37:01.317 --> 00:37:02.358
Here.

526
00:37:10.398 --> 00:37:13.297
(Wang Jung Ae)

527
00:37:15.637 --> 00:37:17.507
So? Do you like it?

528
00:37:23.378 --> 00:37:26.047
We need to know so that we can...

529
00:37:26.047 --> 00:37:28.217
Mi Ae. What happened?

530
00:37:28.217 --> 00:37:30.117
Everyone was worried.

531
00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:31.148
Mi Ae!

532
00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:34.657
Mr. Baek lost his hair, thinking you ran away!

533
00:37:35.088 --> 00:37:36.288
From the stress.

534
00:37:36.558 --> 00:37:37.688
Stop.

535
00:37:39.828 --> 00:37:42.958
Please call her "Jung Ae" instead of Mi Ae.

536
00:37:43.097 --> 00:37:44.168
What?

537
00:37:44.998 --> 00:37:45.998
"Jung Ae"?

538
00:37:45.998 --> 00:37:48.137
Her legal name is Wang Jung Ae.

539
00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:49.797
We should call her by her real name.

540
00:37:52.237 --> 00:37:53.737
Wang Jung Ae.

541
00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:55.677
Jung Ae.

542
00:37:58.277 --> 00:37:59.978
Okay, let's start the meeting.

543
00:38:00.248 --> 00:38:01.277
Yes, sir.

544
00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:07.058
Hey.

545
00:38:07.458 --> 00:38:10.088
I'm going to interview the heads...

546
00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:12.188
of the candidates for dissolution,

547
00:38:12.558 --> 00:38:14.998
so tell Nam Chi Won to come up first.

548
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:17.797
Why aren't you answering me?

549
00:38:18.467 --> 00:38:20.498
- Right now? - Yes. Is that a problem?

550
00:38:21.038 --> 00:38:22.168
Call him.

551
00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:25.938
Yes, sir.

552
00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.847
Your performance is pretty subpar.

553
00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:43.487
Our department isn't judged based on data.

554
00:38:43.588 --> 00:38:46.088
But in an organization... Yes?

555
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:49.128
People are evaluated based on performance,

556
00:38:49.128 --> 00:38:50.927
and that varies by position.

557
00:39:01.808 --> 00:39:02.978
Thank you.

558
00:39:10.688 --> 00:39:11.947
This tastes good.

559
00:39:12.748 --> 00:39:14.157
My assistant...

560
00:39:14.717 --> 00:39:17.188
knows what I like better than anyone.

561
00:39:22.197 --> 00:39:24.697
Okay, then. I'll let you talk.

562
00:39:25.197 --> 00:39:26.398
Ms. Jwa.

563
00:39:27.097 --> 00:39:28.967
You know the underwear you bought yesterday?

564
00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:30.838
Exchange it for another color.

565
00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:36.907
You're covering for me when my wife calls, right?

566
00:39:37.248 --> 00:39:39.547
You're an expert at lying.

567
00:39:43.387 --> 00:39:46.657
You didn't know? Let me explain.

568
00:39:47.358 --> 00:39:49.987
Ms. Jwa is a total pro at handling...

569
00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.527
these personal matters.

570
00:39:51.688 --> 00:39:53.697
I've used several personal assistants,

571
00:39:53.697 --> 00:39:55.828
and no one compares to Ms. Jwa.

572
00:40:06.168 --> 00:40:09.007
I punched you once, remember?

573
00:40:11.078 --> 00:40:12.507
In the elevator at the head office.

574
00:40:13.148 --> 00:40:16.248
You became a total cowardly loser then.

575
00:40:17.317 --> 00:40:18.447
Do you remember?

576
00:40:19.688 --> 00:40:21.157
"There are times..."

577
00:40:23.828 --> 00:40:25.828
"when a man must not avoid a fight."

578
00:40:27.757 --> 00:40:28.757
What's with you?

579
00:40:30.697 --> 00:40:31.828
"That is..."

580
00:40:32.898 --> 00:40:35.467
"when an associate's dream is mocked."

581
00:40:35.697 --> 00:40:38.168
Mommy. Daddy.

582
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.777
This was the preliminary round.

583
00:40:42.338 --> 00:40:44.478
I won't miss during the main round.

584
00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:51.748
I told you then,

585
00:40:52.447 --> 00:40:53.958
that was the preliminary round.

586
00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:09.938
Bring me more.

587
00:41:12.938 --> 00:41:13.938
Yes, sir.

588
00:41:46.578 --> 00:41:48.308
I knew you'd follow me.

589
00:41:50.978 --> 00:41:52.878
You were disappointed in me...

590
00:41:53.817 --> 00:41:56.018
for doing things like that, weren't you?

591
00:41:58.148 --> 00:41:59.788
It's all in the past anyway.

592
00:42:00.617 --> 00:42:02.288
The future is what matters.

593
00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:06.458
What if...

594
00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:09.257
I have to do things like that again?

595
00:42:11.768 --> 00:42:13.338
What then?

596
00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:17.507
If someone is hurt...

597
00:42:17.507 --> 00:42:19.168
by what you do,

598
00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:21.208
I don't think you should do it.

599
00:42:23.108 --> 00:42:24.108
However,

600
00:42:24.878 --> 00:42:27.547
I trust you will make the right decision.

601
00:42:33.288 --> 00:42:34.288
That scared me.

602
00:42:34.558 --> 00:42:37.288
(Misery)

603
00:42:37.487 --> 00:42:38.487
"Misery"?

604
00:42:41.128 --> 00:42:42.498
Sir.

605
00:42:43.367 --> 00:42:45.597
I want to make things right.

606
00:42:47.237 --> 00:42:48.938
Will you help me?

607
00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.407
Anything.

608
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:14.328
Hello, ma'am.

609
00:43:14.927 --> 00:43:16.097
It's been a while.

610
00:43:16.328 --> 00:43:18.597
It has. You look the same.

611
00:43:18.867 --> 00:43:19.867
Sit down.

612
00:43:23.407 --> 00:43:24.407
You know,

613
00:43:24.838 --> 00:43:27.208
you got prettier. Are you seeing someone?

614
00:43:28.177 --> 00:43:29.177
Yes.

615
00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:32.608
So, why did you want to see me?

616
00:43:33.148 --> 00:43:34.148
Well...

617
00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:36.617
I wanted to apologize.

618
00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:40.418
I lied to you about Mr. Bong...

619
00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:42.088
Stop. I know.

620
00:43:44.887 --> 00:43:46.027
I hear...

621
00:43:46.288 --> 00:43:49.358
Jang Woo's nickname is "Rainbow Boss"?

622
00:43:49.458 --> 00:43:51.668
Monday through Sunday.

623
00:43:52.268 --> 00:43:55.237
He sees a different woman each day of the week.

624
00:43:56.808 --> 00:44:00.177
You were Dasan Customer Service, right?

625
00:44:02.878 --> 00:44:05.677
This assistant was Borough Hall.

626
00:44:06.447 --> 00:44:08.617
She was the Community Center.

627
00:44:09.617 --> 00:44:12.617
She was his cell phone customer service.

628
00:44:12.847 --> 00:44:15.117
She was the customer satisfaction office.

629
00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:18.027
She was lost and found.

630
00:44:19.358 --> 00:44:21.257
Those were his contact names...

631
00:44:21.257 --> 00:44:23.157
for the assistants after you as.

632
00:44:23.567 --> 00:44:25.527
They all quit.

633
00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:29.637
They probably left after covering...

634
00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:33.538
for all the women that jerk was seeing.

635
00:44:34.108 --> 00:44:35.438
Ma'am.

636
00:44:51.458 --> 00:44:52.757
It hurts my pride!

637
00:44:53.697 --> 00:44:54.797
I want...

638
00:44:54.898 --> 00:44:58.128
to take him for everything he has...

639
00:44:58.128 --> 00:44:59.567
and leave him penniless!

640
00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:01.467
I want to get revenge.

641
00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:02.467
Well...

642
00:45:03.168 --> 00:45:06.637
If you want to do that, you need solid proof.

643
00:45:06.978 --> 00:45:09.407
Do you have it?

644
00:45:10.578 --> 00:45:11.578
What?

645
00:45:11.907 --> 00:45:15.347
That sounds like you're saying you'll help me.

646
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.047
If someone is being hurt,

647
00:45:18.387 --> 00:45:19.487
I should stop it.

648
00:45:20.288 --> 00:45:21.387
How?

649
00:45:21.788 --> 00:45:22.958
May I...

650
00:45:23.588 --> 00:45:25.387
borrow these phones?

651
00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.597
Thank you.

652
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.467
His wife knew everything already.

653
00:45:39.878 --> 00:45:41.108
She did?

654
00:45:42.578 --> 00:45:44.847
Then you just need to meet those assistants.

655
00:45:45.907 --> 00:45:48.018
Yes. I guess so.

656
00:45:48.547 --> 00:45:49.547
Okay.

657
00:45:54.688 --> 00:45:57.458
Darn it. It's worn out already.

658
00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:07.967
Thank you.

659
00:46:32.157 --> 00:46:35.628
(Shoe Repair)

660
00:46:37.768 --> 00:46:39.228
My heel broke, so...

661
00:46:40.237 --> 00:46:42.398
Okay. Bye.

662
00:46:42.567 --> 00:46:43.567
Okay.

663
00:47:04.757 --> 00:47:05.757
Dad.

664
00:47:06.858 --> 00:47:08.597
Did you eat already?

665
00:47:09.257 --> 00:47:10.268
Yes.

666
00:47:10.628 --> 00:47:13.898
The lady who just left brought me lunch.

667
00:47:15.038 --> 00:47:16.038
Why?

668
00:47:18.737 --> 00:47:20.578
She comes every so often...

669
00:47:21.137 --> 00:47:22.507
and eats with me,

670
00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:25.208
and has coffee with me.

671
00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.737
Raccoon is leaving the office.

672
00:47:48.898 --> 00:47:51.567
Is Mr. Nitpick working late again?

673
00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:53.507
(Is Mr. Nitpick working late again?)

674
00:48:14.228 --> 00:48:15.228
Yoon Yi.

675
00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:51.427
Bo Na.

676
00:48:52.898 --> 00:48:54.567
You said before, remember?

677
00:48:55.998 --> 00:48:58.108
That you pretended not to know...

678
00:48:59.308 --> 00:49:01.578
I was seeing Mr. Nam because you knew...

679
00:49:02.438 --> 00:49:04.378
it would make me uncomfortable.

680
00:49:06.617 --> 00:49:07.617
Yes.

681
00:49:09.047 --> 00:49:10.217
The same for me.

682
00:49:12.217 --> 00:49:14.788
You didn't seem to want to tell me,

683
00:49:15.788 --> 00:49:17.628
so I pretended not to know...

684
00:49:19.628 --> 00:49:20.898
about your father.

685
00:49:29.237 --> 00:49:32.108
Father! I'm back!

686
00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:36.708
You came again? You must be busy.

687
00:49:37.148 --> 00:49:40.617
After giving you this,

688
00:49:40.617 --> 00:49:42.478
I'll go.

689
00:49:43.217 --> 00:49:44.447
Eat with me.

690
00:49:44.987 --> 00:49:46.387
No, no.

691
00:49:46.387 --> 00:49:48.217
I ate already.

692
00:49:48.688 --> 00:49:49.757
I'm full.

693
00:49:50.958 --> 00:49:51.987
Thanks.

694
00:49:52.358 --> 00:49:53.358
Enjoy.

695
00:50:02.097 --> 00:50:03.097
Bo Na.

696
00:50:04.108 --> 00:50:05.708
To be honest,

697
00:50:05.737 --> 00:50:07.677
I hated you a lot.

698
00:50:09.308 --> 00:50:11.507
No matter how hard I tried,

699
00:50:11.907 --> 00:50:13.918
I could never catch up to you.

700
00:50:15.177 --> 00:50:17.148
You were so good at everything.

701
00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:22.217
But your father said...

702
00:50:23.927 --> 00:50:25.887
ever since you were little,

703
00:50:26.527 --> 00:50:29.597
you rarely slept more than four hours a day.

704
00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:34.538
Ever since I found out...

705
00:50:35.367 --> 00:50:38.067
that you gave everything you had,

706
00:50:39.768 --> 00:50:40.777
I...

707
00:50:43.547 --> 00:50:46.208
couldn't hate you anymore.

708
00:50:50.887 --> 00:50:51.887
Just...

709
00:50:52.347 --> 00:50:53.588
hate me.

710
00:50:56.217 --> 00:50:58.588
You have the right to.

711
00:51:02.558 --> 00:51:04.567
Pretty daughter.

712
00:51:07.367 --> 00:51:08.998
That's the first thing...

713
00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:12.438
your father taught me in sign language.

714
00:51:18.148 --> 00:51:20.777
If you can't come back to being my friend,

715
00:51:22.777 --> 00:51:26.217
please return to being the great assistant,

716
00:51:28.387 --> 00:51:29.387
Ma...

717
00:51:31.027 --> 00:51:32.027
Bo...

718
00:51:33.328 --> 00:51:34.328
Na...

719
00:51:36.097 --> 00:51:37.097
from before...

720
00:51:42.567 --> 00:51:43.808
again.

721
00:52:31.518 --> 00:52:33.148
Did you get home safely?

722
00:52:36.958 --> 00:52:39.458
I met a friend by the office.

723
00:52:40.398 --> 00:52:42.328
I'm waiting for the bus now.

724
00:53:22.038 --> 00:53:23.708
Stop being so pathetic by yourself.

725
00:53:24.808 --> 00:53:26.467
Yoon Yi told me you were here.

726
00:53:33.248 --> 00:53:34.777
It's been a while since we came here.

727
00:53:35.347 --> 00:53:37.018
We used to come all the time before.

728
00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:41.487
How many drinks did we buy Yoon Yi...

729
00:53:42.558 --> 00:53:45.228
every time she was scolded by her seniors?

730
00:53:45.387 --> 00:53:47.297
If we had saved that money...

731
00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:52.697
I'll treat today.

732
00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:27.268
Weren't you working late?

733
00:54:27.498 --> 00:54:30.737
I wanted some fresh air. I felt trapped.

734
00:54:33.608 --> 00:54:36.677
You've been popping up and surprising me often.

735
00:54:37.478 --> 00:54:39.447
You were so cold toward me...

736
00:54:39.447 --> 00:54:41.748
when we worked and lived together.

737
00:54:42.248 --> 00:54:45.387
You're being good to me now that we're apart.

738
00:54:46.518 --> 00:54:47.887
Wait a second.

739
00:54:48.257 --> 00:54:50.757
Are you saying you prefer being apart?

740
00:54:52.558 --> 00:54:56.427
You need to pay rent even if you're not there.

741
00:54:56.768 --> 00:54:59.097
Did you send me money for the water bill?

742
00:54:59.498 --> 00:55:00.967
I don't remember seeing it.

743
00:55:01.438 --> 00:55:03.097
I did. Check.

744
00:55:03.097 --> 00:55:05.967
I checked just earlier. It wasn't there.

745
00:55:06.777 --> 00:55:09.237
I did pay. We split down the middle.

746
00:55:09.578 --> 00:55:11.308
Yes, half-half.

747
00:55:11.507 --> 00:55:13.648
- Did you check? - Yes.

748
00:55:17.217 --> 00:55:20.918
(Lost and Found)

749
00:55:23.858 --> 00:55:26.898
Hello, my name is Jwa Yoon Yi.

750
00:55:27.328 --> 00:55:29.828
Yes. Well...

751
00:55:29.898 --> 00:55:32.367
You were Bong Jang Woo's personal assistant, right?

752
00:55:34.567 --> 00:55:37.567
"Buy underwear." "Book a room at a hotel."

753
00:55:38.608 --> 00:55:40.708
He made me do all sorts of stuff.

754
00:55:41.177 --> 00:55:44.148
And he said to submit receipt for reimbursement.

755
00:55:44.547 --> 00:55:45.947
By chance,

756
00:55:46.378 --> 00:55:49.478
do you have anything that may be evidence?

757
00:55:54.887 --> 00:55:57.728
He's famous for framing his assistants,

758
00:55:57.757 --> 00:56:00.697
so I took pictures and recorded conversations.

759
00:56:18.847 --> 00:56:20.177
Mr. Nam!

760
00:56:21.248 --> 00:56:22.518
Mr. Hwangbo!

761
00:56:24.288 --> 00:56:25.288
Hi.

762
00:56:25.788 --> 00:56:27.558
Welcome to my home!

763
00:56:29.987 --> 00:56:33.558
What the... Are you wearing matching outfits?

764
00:56:34.597 --> 00:56:37.498
He said this was a rule a freeloader must keep.

765
00:56:39.268 --> 00:56:41.137
I said I didn't want to wear it.

766
00:56:41.567 --> 00:56:42.867
It looks good on you.

767
00:56:49.407 --> 00:56:50.847
This is plenty.

768
00:56:51.907 --> 00:56:55.117
I'll put it together and send it to a reporter.

769
00:56:55.777 --> 00:56:58.248
Okay. I'll trust you with it,

770
00:56:58.487 --> 00:56:59.788
since you were a reporter.

771
00:57:02.588 --> 00:57:05.657
Remember me

772
00:57:06.628 --> 00:57:10.467
Think of me

773
00:57:11.498 --> 00:57:14.498
I'll wait for you

774
00:57:16.967 --> 00:57:19.938
Sir. The front desk called.

775
00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:21.737
You have a guest.

776
00:57:21.777 --> 00:57:23.378
A guest? Who?

777
00:57:23.748 --> 00:57:25.547
He said it's a young woman...

778
00:57:25.547 --> 00:57:27.547
who looks a little like a model.

779
00:57:27.648 --> 00:57:29.117
Like a model?

780
00:57:29.378 --> 00:57:30.487
Yes.

781
00:57:31.987 --> 00:57:33.887
It must be Mi Sun. No.

782
00:57:34.387 --> 00:57:35.817
It's Yun Hee. Yun Hee.

783
00:57:35.817 --> 00:57:38.628
She shouldn't show up without calling first.

784
00:57:38.858 --> 00:57:41.128
She keeps me on my toes...

785
00:57:41.128 --> 00:57:43.367
all the time, day and night.

786
00:57:43.867 --> 00:57:44.898
I'll be back.

787
00:57:59.777 --> 00:58:00.918
Where is she?

788
00:58:03.617 --> 00:58:04.817
There he is!

789
00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.688
You made your assistants cover up your affairs?

790
00:58:07.688 --> 00:58:10.387
You wrote off your hotel as a business expense?

791
00:58:10.427 --> 00:58:12.657
You framed your assistant and got promoted alone?

792
00:58:12.657 --> 00:58:14.097
- Please tell us. - I did not.

793
00:58:14.097 --> 00:58:15.527
- Is it true? - What?

794
00:58:15.527 --> 00:58:18.027
What are you saying? I never did that!

795
00:58:18.097 --> 00:58:20.038
- Tell us. - Admit it.

796
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:22.467
- We have proof. - What proof? I never!

797
00:58:22.597 --> 00:58:23.967
Please tell us.

798
00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:29.777
How dare you...

799
00:58:37.688 --> 00:58:40.088
I said I'd protect my associate's dream.

800
00:58:41.717 --> 00:58:43.527
Gosh. That's a lot.

801
00:58:43.927 --> 00:58:46.927
There's no big news to cover now,

802
00:58:47.027 --> 00:58:49.898
so your story will be front page for a week.

803
00:58:50.728 --> 00:58:51.797
Congratulations.

804
00:58:54.038 --> 00:58:55.538
Chi Won, you punk.

805
00:58:57.038 --> 00:58:58.067
Just wait.

806
00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:22.197
Bong Jang Woo.

807
00:59:47.188 --> 00:59:49.458
Did you have fun until now?

808
00:59:49.987 --> 00:59:51.058
Heng Ja.

809
00:59:52.358 --> 00:59:53.358
Don't kill me.

810
00:59:54.498 --> 00:59:57.297
Yes, I'm your wife, Park Heng Ja.

811
00:59:57.467 --> 00:59:58.998
I won't kill you.

812
00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:02.668
But you'll end up begging me to kill you.

813
01:00:02.668 --> 01:00:04.507
- No! - Let's go, Jang Woo.

814
01:00:04.507 --> 01:00:06.907
- No. - Come with me!

815
01:00:06.907 --> 01:00:08.808
- You're dead! - No!

816
01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:17.487
- No! - Stop!

817
01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.817
Heng Ja...

818
01:00:25.558 --> 01:00:28.128
- Let's go! Come here! - Heng Ja.

819
01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:29.828
Oh, dear.

820
01:00:30.097 --> 01:00:32.628
He was so arrogant.

821
01:00:32.728 --> 01:00:34.597
He's dead today.

822
01:00:37.237 --> 01:00:39.038
Mission clear.

823
01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:40.378
No.

824
01:00:40.907 --> 01:00:43.248
The real mission begins now.

825
01:00:47.648 --> 01:00:49.248
Yes.

826
01:00:59.387 --> 01:01:01.257
- Get up, sir. - Wake up.

827
01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.358
Sir.

828
01:01:02.828 --> 01:01:04.967
- Watch it! - Careful.

829
01:01:05.297 --> 01:01:08.338
- Bring me Raccoon. - Raccoon?

830
01:01:08.838 --> 01:01:10.007
What raccoon?

831
01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:13.578
- Raccoon. - No!

832
01:01:13.578 --> 01:01:16.438
- She's a frog. - A frog.

833
01:01:16.438 --> 01:01:17.978
- A frog? - Who made him drink?

834
01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.148
It wasn't me!

835
01:01:19.148 --> 01:01:21.277
He's still so cool.

836
01:01:21.277 --> 01:01:23.547
- You keep quiet. - Raccoon.

837
01:01:23.617 --> 01:01:25.487
- Bring me my raccoon. - Send him to the raccoon.

838
01:01:26.117 --> 01:01:28.088
- Address. - You don't know it?

839
01:01:28.688 --> 01:01:30.458
- Hi, Raccoon. - I'm not your raccoon!

840
01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:32.558
- Don't touch me! - Hey, hey.

841
01:01:32.958 --> 01:01:34.558
- Send him away! - Carry him.

842
01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:36.867
- Send him away. - Pick him up.

843
01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:42.567
Here. Sir.

844
01:01:42.768 --> 01:01:44.567
- Hurry. - Thank you.

845
01:01:45.938 --> 01:01:47.777
- Thank you! - Sir.

846
01:01:48.308 --> 01:01:49.338
- Okay. - Hey.

847
01:01:49.737 --> 01:01:50.847
I'm...

848
01:01:51.108 --> 01:01:52.878
- not drunk. - Sure.

849
01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.487
- He is drunk. He is. - Wait!

850
01:01:57.487 --> 01:01:59.317
- Sir! - That's a wall.

851
01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.717
- His head. - Hey.

852
01:02:02.717 --> 01:02:04.628
- Careful. - Okay.

853
01:02:04.628 --> 01:02:06.487
- Get the key. - Protect the dreams!

854
01:02:06.487 --> 01:02:07.558
Open it!

855
01:02:07.797 --> 01:02:10.328
- I can do it. - Hurry it up!

856
01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:11.828
I can.

857
01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:15.067
No! Legs in! Pull your legs in!

858
01:02:15.067 --> 01:02:16.668
Why are your legs...

859
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.137
- Shoot. - Are you okay?

860
01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:22.177
He's tall and heavy.

861
01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:23.708
Who's doing that?

862
01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:25.978
- Don't kiss me! - Careful.

863
01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:28.047
So heavy.

864
01:02:28.547 --> 01:02:29.717
He'll be fine, right?

865
01:02:29.748 --> 01:02:30.947
- He will. - Let's go.

866
01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.688
Shouldn't you have carried him?

867
01:02:32.688 --> 01:02:34.018
You know I'm weak.

868
01:02:36.688 --> 01:02:41.558
Raccoon...
