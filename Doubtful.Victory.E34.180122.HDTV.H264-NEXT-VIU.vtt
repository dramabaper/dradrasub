00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:15.872
(Episode 34)

2
00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:18.896
Where is this place?

3
00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:22.236
I don't know.

4
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.466
Then you should ask him more.

5
00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:28.407
How can we find anything with this?

6
00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:32.976
Be gentle.

7
00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:35.146
Don't frown.

8
00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:38.987
Mr. Cha.

9
00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:43.627
Where is this place?

10
00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:54.167
Mrs. Lee.

11
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.766
Why do you keep asking me?

12
00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.607
You know where that is.

13
00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:00.707
When Young Min died,

14
00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.677
you told me to bury him there.

15
00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:06.876
Why is he calling you Mrs. Lee?

16
00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:08.876
Lee Kwang Ho's wife?

17
00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:13.456
Mr. Cha.

18
00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:16.787
It's because I don't remember.

19
00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:18.956
I keep forgetting.

20
00:01:21.997 --> 00:01:23.357
I'm the same.

21
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.736
When you don't remember,

22
00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:31.667
you should exercise.

23
00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:37.376
Shoulder, shoulder.

24
00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:40.576
Up and down.

25
00:01:47.216 --> 00:01:48.456
Gook Su Ran.

26
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.527
Yes?

27
00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:55.156
Thank you...

28
00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:57.997
for saving me.

29
00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:05.167
But you witch...

30
00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:08.236
put me in the asylum!

31
00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:09.776
You locked me in there...

32
00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.377
for a year. No, two years!

33
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.176
- Die, witch! - Mr. Cha.

34
00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:16.217
Die, witch!

35
00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:17.787
- Die! - Mr. Cha.

36
00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:19.516
- Mr. Cha. - Die!

37
00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:21.757
What were you doing earlier?

38
00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.056
Shoulder, shoulder.

39
00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:30.266
Shoulder, shoulder.

40
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.926
- That's right. - Up and down.

41
00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.996
- Up and down. - Why don't you there and do it?

42
00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:37.137
- All right. - Shoulder, shoulder.

43
00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:40.607
Up and down.

44
00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:42.706
Shoulder, shoulder.

45
00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:45.306
Right foot.

46
00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:46.947
I don't think we can get anymore out of him.

47
00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.486
Right foot. Right. Left.

48
00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:53.317
That means we have to use this to find it.

49
00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:55.956
Do you have any idea where this could be?

50
00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:58.556
Could it be Lee Kwang Ho's vacation home or hometown?

51
00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:01.257
He said Mrs. Lee ordered him to do it.

52
00:03:01.257 --> 00:03:03.597
It sounded like she knew it well.

53
00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:06.727
Was there a place she went frequently?

54
00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:09.896
Right foot.

55
00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:11.967
A church?

56
00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:13.977
Right.

57
00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:15.076
A church?

58
00:03:15.137 --> 00:03:17.347
Is Mrs. Lee a Christian?

59
00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:18.877
No.

60
00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:20.847
It's just a small church...

61
00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:23.687
in the outskirts they have been sponsoring for a long time.

62
00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:25.546
Try to remember the name.

63
00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:30.086
So we can at least look up its old pictures.

64
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.426
Right foot.

65
00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:35.727
Right. Left.

66
00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:51.107
Thankfully, it's still here.

67
00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:52.407
(Hope Orphanage)

68
00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:54.676
Ms. Hong's records must be here.

69
00:03:54.877 --> 00:03:57.687
I know. If they're not here,

70
00:03:58.417 --> 00:03:59.486
we have nowhere else to go.

71
00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:02.387
Hey. Don't worry. They'll be here.

72
00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:05.586
I just got a feeling.

73
00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:10.426
All right. I hope your feeling is right.

74
00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:14.167
You're looking for Hong Mi Ok?

75
00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:17.407
This is Kim Kkot Bi.

76
00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:20.277
Kim Kkot Bi?

77
00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:23.037
Yes. She used to be our benefactor.

78
00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:26.506
Did something happen to her?

79
00:04:29.816 --> 00:04:31.746
She passed away 10 years ago.

80
00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:34.316
Goodness. I see.

81
00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:36.217
That's why she hasn't been coming here.

82
00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:40.056
Do you know Choi Yeon Mi by the way?

83
00:04:40.357 --> 00:04:41.696
I don't know her.

84
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:48.397
Do you have any childhood pictures of Kim Kkot Bi?

85
00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:52.207
And of anyone who was here with her at the time?

86
00:04:52.306 --> 00:04:53.506
I'll look for them.

87
00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.337
We have a lot of sponsors who are from this orphanage.

88
00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:58.277
I'll ask them.

89
00:04:58.407 --> 00:04:59.777
Please wait here.

90
00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:04.616
So Ms. Hong might be the one who made the settlement...

91
00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:06.386
when my mom got into an accident.

92
00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:08.287
Yes.

93
00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:12.357
Then were they really friends?

94
00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:15.227
Were they here together?

95
00:05:16.597 --> 00:05:17.667
I'm not sure.

96
00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.996
Do you have any pictures of your mom?

97
00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:25.006
If you show them her picture,

98
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:26.537
they might recognize her.

99
00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:28.936
I did have her picture.

100
00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:30.407
One picture.

101
00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:33.946
(Bathhouse)

102
00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:37.017
(Dongha Photo Studio)

103
00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:41.686
(Dongha Photo Studio)

104
00:05:48.527 --> 00:05:50.496
Shall we take a picture?

105
00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:55.636
And that night she got into an accident.

106
00:05:57.366 --> 00:05:58.967
After she died,

107
00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:01.736
they tried to send me to an orphanage, so I ran away.

108
00:06:02.037 --> 00:06:03.876
Then, I remembered the picture...

109
00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:06.207
and went to the photo studio.

110
00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:10.746
"My mom will be here soon. Please show me the picture."

111
00:06:11.347 --> 00:06:12.746
I said that, and he showed it to me.

112
00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:15.686
So I snatched it and ran.

113
00:06:18.157 --> 00:06:19.857
That was the first time I stole something.

114
00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:26.267
Yes.

115
00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:29.066
Okay. We'll be right in.

116
00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:32.306
Hey. They found Ms. Hong.

117
00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:33.537
Kim Kkot Bi.

118
00:06:34.837 --> 00:06:35.907
Okay.

119
00:06:35.977 --> 00:06:38.876
Nice job, Dae Woong.

120
00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:41.717
Did you find something?

121
00:06:41.876 --> 00:06:43.077
We found Jang Pil Sung's car.

122
00:06:43.077 --> 00:06:45.046
He got a parking ticket.

123
00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:46.647
Okay. Go ahead.

124
00:06:46.647 --> 00:06:47.686
Yes, sir.

125
00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:50.756
- Inspector Park. - Yes?

126
00:06:51.426 --> 00:06:54.957
Didn't Officer Oh give you Mr. Cha's ripped notepad?

127
00:06:57.496 --> 00:06:59.167
- What about it? - Well,

128
00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.467
Officer Oh and General Manager Kwak fought over it, and it got ripped.

129
00:07:01.897 --> 00:07:04.667
I saw him get it, but you aren't telling us to investigate it.

130
00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.337
I got it. Lieutenant Jin and Officer Oh...

131
00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:08.777
are doing the investigation.

132
00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:09.837
I see.

133
00:07:10.147 --> 00:07:12.277
- Aren't you coming? - Coming!

134
00:07:13.107 --> 00:07:14.246
- Go ahead. - Bye.

135
00:07:19.686 --> 00:07:21.457
He abandoned his car.

136
00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:24.027
That's why it's the hardest to find a police officer.

137
00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:25.787
They know all our tricks.

138
00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:29.696
I guess you didn't find him.

139
00:07:30.527 --> 00:07:31.897
Why are you following us?

140
00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.736
We're after Jang Pil Sung.

141
00:07:33.897 --> 00:07:35.066
How did you know he was here?

142
00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:38.767
His cloned phone was turned off at this location.

143
00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:40.936
Hey, Myun Joong. Watch your mouth.

144
00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:43.037
You can keep talking.

145
00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:45.407
That information is useless anyway.

146
00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:49.077
In conclusion, Jang Pil Sung dropped everything here...

147
00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:50.986
and took off.

148
00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:54.157
Why are you looking for Jang Pil Sung?

149
00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:55.857
Did Lee Kwang Ho tell you to find him?

150
00:07:56.857 --> 00:07:58.157
It's none of your business.

151
00:07:58.486 --> 00:07:59.827
- Let's go. - Okay.

152
00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:01.696
Let's get going.

153
00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:03.727
That jerk! Over there.

154
00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:04.967
That punk!

155
00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:06.967
- Hey. - Get out of the way.

156
00:08:09.936 --> 00:08:10.967
Gosh.

157
00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:14.736
That was crazy.

158
00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:17.077
What was that for? Do you want to fight us?

159
00:08:17.207 --> 00:08:18.506
- Hey. - Yes?

160
00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:19.977
Who was that?

161
00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:21.446
The cafe part-timer.

162
00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:24.046
He really is a professional.

163
00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:25.347
Why is he so fast?

164
00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:27.886
Who was it?

165
00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:29.686
He's from your side.

166
00:08:29.957 --> 00:08:31.686
Lee Kwang Ho is after Jang Pil Sung.

167
00:08:33.087 --> 00:08:34.327
Aren't you on the same side?

168
00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:35.756
Why aren't you working together?

169
00:08:36.656 --> 00:08:38.166
You didn't know a hitman was involved.

170
00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:43.067
Hey, did he come here to get you guys?

171
00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:47.177
No, he didn't. He came here to get Jang Pil Sung.

172
00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:51.347
You guys can't catch our hitman.

173
00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:53.077
- You should leave. - Okay.

174
00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:58.047
If you think you'll get back-stabbed,

175
00:08:58.486 --> 00:09:01.587
call us. We'll help you.

176
00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:05.187
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

177
00:09:05.187 --> 00:09:06.187
Here.

178
00:09:07.357 --> 00:09:08.357
Take it.

179
00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:10.797
You look good.

180
00:09:10.797 --> 00:09:12.197
He's something.

181
00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:18.636
You lied, didn't you?

182
00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:21.006
The hitman isn't with us, is he?

183
00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:24.746
Did Manager Lee send him because he knew you lied?

184
00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:27.376
He came here to catch Jang Pil Sung. Don't worry.

185
00:09:27.616 --> 00:09:29.977
He would've appeared if he was here to get us.

186
00:09:30.516 --> 00:09:32.986
Shouldn't we still report to Chairwoman Gook?

187
00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:34.116
Are you crazy?

188
00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:37.927
(Donation Recipients)

189
00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:48.036
Yes?

190
00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:51.866
If you want to catch Lee Kwang Ho, come down now.

191
00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:53.437
Alone, of course.

192
00:09:53.937 --> 00:09:55.006
Okay.

193
00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:03.447
The boss is calling.

194
00:10:04.547 --> 00:10:06.486
Can you stay alone for a minute?

195
00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:08.557
You can't run away, okay?

196
00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:17.126
The previous director...

197
00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:20.097
kept this in a separate album.

198
00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:23.197
It's Hong Mi Ok, isn't it?

199
00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:26.636
That's...

200
00:10:28.736 --> 00:10:30.177
Choi Yeon Mi?

201
00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:36.477
The bracelets...

202
00:10:37.717 --> 00:10:41.256
Do you know the person beside Kim Kkot Bi?

203
00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:45.256
No. I can check, but don't get your hopes up.

204
00:10:45.256 --> 00:10:46.427
It's such an old picture.

205
00:10:47.156 --> 00:10:50.597
Also, could we take this photograph?

206
00:10:50.597 --> 00:10:52.327
(Hope Orphanage)

207
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.207
Are you all right?

208
00:10:58.406 --> 00:10:59.406
It was true.

209
00:11:00.677 --> 00:11:02.437
They were friends.

210
00:11:02.636 --> 00:11:04.347
You really didn't know?

211
00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:08.577
Ms. Hong didn't know you were her friend's son either.

212
00:11:08.677 --> 00:11:09.717
No.

213
00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:11.986
I think she knew.

214
00:11:17.486 --> 00:11:18.756
That's unique.

215
00:11:19.587 --> 00:11:21.227
It looks handmade.

216
00:11:23.327 --> 00:11:24.366
Yes.

217
00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:26.727
My mom did.

218
00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:29.166
Your mom?

219
00:11:32.906 --> 00:11:35.837
Your mom is good with her hands.

220
00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:41.717
We got close after working together.

221
00:11:41.717 --> 00:11:44.687
I even showed her my mom's picture.

222
00:11:45.317 --> 00:11:49.256
Then your mother's death must be related to Ms. Hong's death.

223
00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:53.427
Let's go.

224
00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:09.177
You sure have the guts.

225
00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:13.307
A suspect brought himself in front of the Prosecutors' Office.

226
00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:17.486
You should have prepared some handcuffs.

227
00:12:17.616 --> 00:12:20.386
I should have, but I have yet to grow the habit.

228
00:12:22.656 --> 00:12:24.457
Maybe you got too excited...

229
00:12:27.797 --> 00:12:29.797
to catch Lee Kwang Ho and forgot.

230
00:12:32.727 --> 00:12:35.536
What do you have to make you so confident?

231
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.006
I have high expectations.

232
00:12:43.977 --> 00:12:46.947
Odong Blowfish House. Ms. Hong's nails.

233
00:12:48.447 --> 00:12:49.977
What can I use that for?

234
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.457
You're a loner, aren't you?

235
00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:57.357
Didn't you know?

236
00:12:58.026 --> 00:13:01.227
Lee Kwang Ho is the one that choked her.

237
00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:04.766
And?

238
00:13:05.467 --> 00:13:08.766
That won't be enough to prove he's the assailant.

239
00:13:08.766 --> 00:13:09.996
No.

240
00:13:11.406 --> 00:13:13.166
This is only a sample.

241
00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:15.437
I have all 10 fingers.

242
00:13:15.437 --> 00:13:18.746
At least one of them will have Lee Kwang Ho's DNA on it.

243
00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:26.187
- What's the condition? - Lift my travel ban.

244
00:13:26.486 --> 00:13:29.057
It's not in my nature to sneak out on a boat.

245
00:13:29.357 --> 00:13:31.656
You can do that, right?

246
00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:35.457
I'm not asking you to get rid of my evidence or to free me.

247
00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:37.827
You will give me the rest in exchange?

248
00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:40.536
How?

249
00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:42.297
Once the plane takes off,

250
00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:45.236
I'll tell you where I hid them.

251
00:13:49.607 --> 00:13:51.307
It's hard to trust you.

252
00:13:51.607 --> 00:13:54.016
I don't even know if that's genuine.

253
00:13:54.646 --> 00:13:57.587
Also, you're not the type to keep your promises.

254
00:14:01.886 --> 00:14:02.886
Then,

255
00:14:03.286 --> 00:14:06.057
you can forget about it all...

256
00:14:06.057 --> 00:14:07.756
and go back in.

257
00:14:08.656 --> 00:14:10.827
You sure have a temper.

258
00:14:11.097 --> 00:14:14.136
I know you don't have anyone else to help you except for me.

259
00:14:18.866 --> 00:14:19.967
Bingo.

260
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:26.347
Call me in four hours.

261
00:14:27.177 --> 00:14:29.516
I have to check if this belongs to Ms. Hong first.

262
00:14:29.847 --> 00:14:30.947
Once confirmed,

263
00:14:31.717 --> 00:14:34.656
I'll lift your travel ban.

264
00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:38.486
However, I'll decide how, when, and where...

265
00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:41.396
I will receive the remaining nails.

266
00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:43.327
Are you in?

267
00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:45.467
For now, yes.

268
00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:55.491
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E34 Doubtful Victory "Who is Kim Kkot Bi?"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

269
00:15:01.646 --> 00:15:02.776
General Manager Kwak.

270
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.496
This must be fate.

271
00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:18.227
I was waiting here to drive Chairwoman Gook,

272
00:15:19.097 --> 00:15:21.636
but I ran into you again.

273
00:15:22.036 --> 00:15:23.136
And?

274
00:15:23.837 --> 00:15:24.937
Let's go.

275
00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:29.906
It would only make things worse if you make a scene.

276
00:15:56.766 --> 00:15:58.036
Can you handle it alone?

277
00:15:58.467 --> 00:15:59.467
Yes.

278
00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:02.636
You need to get Jang Pil Sung too.

279
00:16:03.136 --> 00:16:05.276
This was a direct order from Manager Lee.

280
00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:06.307
Make sure to get it right.

281
00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:07.876
Okay.

282
00:16:08.547 --> 00:16:09.646
From now on,

283
00:16:10.187 --> 00:16:13.656
you should only do work ordered by Manager Lee or myself.

284
00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:16.886
Okay.

285
00:16:32.006 --> 00:16:33.977
How was the meeting with Jang Pil Sung?

286
00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:46.646
You're so quick-witted.

287
00:16:47.557 --> 00:16:51.227
I don't know what you talked about, but this is where it'll end.

288
00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:55.156
General Manager Kwak just took Jang Pil Sung away.

289
00:16:58.597 --> 00:17:00.666
What are you trying to pull?

290
00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:01.996
Relax.

291
00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:03.807
Who knows?

292
00:17:04.436 --> 00:17:07.277
If the evidence comes up, I may give it you.

293
00:17:09.037 --> 00:17:10.146
To me?

294
00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:13.077
- Do you mean that? - We'll see.

295
00:17:13.847 --> 00:17:16.616
Even if you make a deal with him,

296
00:17:16.616 --> 00:17:19.247
you only have a 50 percent chance of succeeding.

297
00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.216
You can't play hard to get with me.

298
00:17:22.156 --> 00:17:25.557
I already know you'll give it to me.

299
00:17:29.726 --> 00:17:33.196
This room is so chilly because of you.

300
00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:37.237
It looks like you're trying to take your revenge...

301
00:17:37.237 --> 00:17:39.136
on Lee Kwang Ho.

302
00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:42.107
His men could steal it away.

303
00:17:42.537 --> 00:17:44.706
While you're slacking off,

304
00:17:44.807 --> 00:17:47.547
Lee Kwang Ho could have hired someone to steal it.

305
00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:48.747
You're right.

306
00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:52.087
Manager Lee is not the type of person who would just stay still.

307
00:17:53.386 --> 00:17:55.357
Should we call for backup?

308
00:17:58.456 --> 00:17:59.557
We're back.

309
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:03.426
There is something we must tell you.

310
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.527
- Mr. Cha... - I know.

311
00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:07.737
The notebook?

312
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:11.166
Are you going to continue hiding things?

313
00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:13.906
- Well... - I'm sorry.

314
00:18:15.077 --> 00:18:16.136
In his notebook,

315
00:18:17.476 --> 00:18:19.007
I found my mom's name.

316
00:18:26.716 --> 00:18:29.686
Are you saying your mom knew...

317
00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:31.287
Lee Kwang Ho and Mr. Cha?

318
00:18:32.656 --> 00:18:33.696
Yes.

319
00:18:33.857 --> 00:18:37.726
No matter the reason, you must always report to me.

320
00:18:37.896 --> 00:18:40.537
If you do that one more time, you'll be cut from the team.

321
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:44.206
Do you understand? That's my last warning.

322
00:18:45.406 --> 00:18:47.737
- Yes, sir. - So, what did you find out?

323
00:18:56.347 --> 00:18:58.916
It turns out that Ms. Hong...

324
00:18:59.987 --> 00:19:03.987
and his late mother Choi Yeon Mi were best friends.

325
00:19:04.757 --> 00:19:05.757
What?

326
00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:14.666
Yes. Hello? Yes?

327
00:19:16.497 --> 00:19:17.767
Backup?

328
00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:20.737
Okay.

329
00:19:20.737 --> 00:19:24.047
Hey, call Min Pyo and Dae Woong. We're needed for backup.

330
00:19:24.446 --> 00:19:25.476
Okay.

331
00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:28.017
Where is Jang Pil Sung?

332
00:19:29.347 --> 00:19:30.347
Okay.

333
00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.247
I have a bad feeling. Should we call the boys?

334
00:19:33.787 --> 00:19:37.327
No. It's not a good idea to call them in this situation.

335
00:19:38.956 --> 00:19:40.857
We don't know who is on our side.

336
00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:43.626
Manager Lee's spies will be among them.

337
00:19:44.126 --> 00:19:45.166
That's true.

338
00:19:50.807 --> 00:19:52.507
Quiet him down.

339
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.107
I need to report to Chairwoman Gook.

340
00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:58.946
He's so energetic.

341
00:20:10.327 --> 00:20:11.327
Mister.

342
00:20:14.557 --> 00:20:15.956
What? What?

343
00:20:18.597 --> 00:20:19.696
You're choking me...

344
00:20:19.827 --> 00:20:21.067
You're choking me.

345
00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:23.267
That hurts!

346
00:20:24.866 --> 00:20:26.976
Just stay still. I said that it hurts.

347
00:20:29.007 --> 00:20:30.037
Okay.

348
00:20:33.376 --> 00:20:34.577
What's taking them so long?

349
00:21:26.297 --> 00:21:27.666
They were here already.

350
00:21:27.797 --> 00:21:29.067
I think we're too late.

351
00:21:29.097 --> 00:21:31.537
Let's look around here first.

352
00:21:31.537 --> 00:21:32.537
Okay.

353
00:21:34.406 --> 00:21:35.406
What is this?

354
00:21:38.807 --> 00:21:40.747
Crowbars are best for this.

355
00:21:40.747 --> 00:21:42.676
Wait. Just press the button.

356
00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:43.716
Okay.

357
00:21:45.946 --> 00:21:46.987
Chief Jang!

358
00:21:48.456 --> 00:21:49.956
Hey, are you okay?

359
00:21:53.827 --> 00:21:55.126
He's fine.

360
00:21:58.126 --> 00:22:00.337
What about the NIS guys?

361
00:22:00.466 --> 00:22:03.136
Dae Woong, you and I should look for traces.

362
00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:07.277
You two can take this car just as it is.

363
00:22:07.337 --> 00:22:08.406
- Okay. - Okay.

364
00:22:08.406 --> 00:22:09.436
Go.

365
00:22:13.077 --> 00:22:14.116

366
00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:16.847
Did you find Hope Orphanage too?

367
00:22:17.487 --> 00:22:19.847
I'm going back in now. I'll see you there.

Hey.

370
00:22:29.196 --> 00:22:32.527
I have to see Officer Oh.

371
00:22:34.997 --> 00:22:37.007
I just saw him go in.

372
00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:40.906
They arrested Chief Jang.

373
00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:43.337
I heard.

374
00:22:46.676 --> 00:22:47.747
You should go.

375
00:22:49.247 --> 00:22:50.247
Hey.

376
00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:54.487
Do you want to see Kang sometime?

377
00:22:55.987 --> 00:22:58.787
Su Chil thinks you should too.

378
00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:02.226
I'm not sure.

379
00:23:03.226 --> 00:23:04.297
Later.

380
00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:06.567
We can do that later.

381
00:23:22.247 --> 00:23:23.277
Give me the evidence.

382
00:23:24.287 --> 00:23:25.616
What evidence?

383
00:23:28.017 --> 00:23:29.357
I'm a victim of an abduction.

384
00:23:29.916 --> 00:23:31.587
Is this how you conduct victim questionings?

385
00:23:35.626 --> 00:23:38.396
Have you lost your mind while running around?

386
00:23:38.497 --> 00:23:39.696
Are you crazy?

387
00:23:41.896 --> 00:23:44.537
Let's not waste time. Just give it to me.

388
00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:50.277
Call Kim Yoon Su.

389
00:23:52.476 --> 00:23:54.317
I'll only talk with him.

390
00:23:56.347 --> 00:23:57.987
You're driving me crazy.

391
00:24:01.817 --> 00:24:03.857
He wants to make a deal.

392
00:24:04.587 --> 00:24:05.686
It's obvious.

393
00:24:06.557 --> 00:24:08.827
It'll be over if we find out where the evidence is.

394
00:24:11.527 --> 00:24:12.866
Where could it be?

395
00:24:14.337 --> 00:24:15.537
That man...

396
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:18.607
would never tell us himself.

397
00:24:47.237 --> 00:24:49.067
It looks like you're going to hit me.

398
00:24:49.837 --> 00:24:51.067
I might.

399
00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:56.476
Where did you put Ms. Hong's evidence?

400
00:25:00.777 --> 00:25:03.446
What? What is this?

401

403

Bring the key.

404
00:25:10.487 --> 00:25:11.956
I said, give it to me.

405
00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:14.027
How can I give you something I don't have?

406
00:25:16.226 --> 00:25:18.866
Do you think I would carry around something so important?

407
00:25:18.866 --> 00:25:19.926
Yes.

408
00:25:20.597 --> 00:25:24.107
It's too important for you to leave it out of your reach.

409
00:25:25.966 --> 00:25:29.237
If you want it so badly, then give me something in return.

410

412

Let go.

413

Stay still.

414
00:25:43.926 --> 00:25:45.027
You little...

415
00:25:57.936 --> 00:26:00.037
Hey. Stay still! What are you doing?

416
00:26:20.557 --> 00:26:21.597
A little more.

417
00:26:26.597 --> 00:26:29.337
Do you think the evidence will be okay?

418
00:26:29.636 --> 00:26:31.366
I don't think you should worry.

419
00:26:31.906 --> 00:26:35.577
It's over 10 years old, but it was stored well.

420
00:26:35.577 --> 00:26:38.446
You won't have to worry. Also, the table was clean.

421
00:26:38.446 --> 00:26:41.676
However, Officer Oh touched it.

422
00:26:41.847 --> 00:26:43.686
We have to get his DNA,

423
00:26:43.847 --> 00:26:45.416
cross it out from the evidence,

424
00:26:45.616 --> 00:26:47.517
then write the result.

425
00:26:48.057 --> 00:26:50.226
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

426
00:26:50.656 --> 00:26:52.827
You found the evidence.

427
00:26:54.497 --> 00:26:57.166
Would you prefer this to be done as soon as possible?

428
00:26:57.166 --> 00:26:59.166
Yes. I would appreciate that.

429
00:26:59.926 --> 00:27:02.237
Do you have a DNA sample of the suspect?

430
00:27:02.237 --> 00:27:04.567
No, well... Not yet.

431
00:27:04.567 --> 00:27:06.567
It's Lee Kwang Ho, we're talking about.

432
00:27:06.567 --> 00:27:08.607
There's no way you would have it...

433
00:27:08.607 --> 00:27:10.107
unless you stole it.

434
00:27:10.577 --> 00:27:12.906
Ask for a warrant...

435
00:27:12.906 --> 00:27:14.347
to get Lee Kwang Ho's DNA sample.

436
00:27:14.747 --> 00:27:15.946
Okay. I will.

437

Thank you. We'll get going.

438

I told you not to jump in.

439

You'll trip over yourself before we catch Lee Kwang Ho.

440

I'm sorry.

441

Let's request for a warrant first.

442
00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:33.426
Will they approve?

443
00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:36.837
Of course not. We can't even get a search warrant.

444

I wish we had his comb or his toothbrush.

445
00:27:41.037 --> 00:27:42.876
If we find out it's him, it'll be easier...

446
00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:44.406
for us to demand his DNA sample.

447
00:27:44.507 --> 00:27:45.777
That's true.

448
00:27:46.406 --> 00:27:50.116
But even if we were to tail him, he's always with his guards.

449
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:54.186

I also heard you made a mistake.

- Yes. - It's okay.
