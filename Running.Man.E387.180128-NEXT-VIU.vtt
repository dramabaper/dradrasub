1
00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.780
My gosh, hello.

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.709
- Hello. Let me say hello again. - Hi.

3
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.719
- All right. - Hello.

4
00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:15.950
Hurry, and take the side seat.

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.950
I haven't been to a rest area for a while.

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.690
Rest areas serve great food, my gosh.

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.889
I must eat pork cutlet.

8
00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.220
- Me too. - Pork cutlet.

9
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.490
- Pork cutlets are delicious. - Or I want udon.

10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.859
- I had pork cutlet yesterday. - I want to eat udon.

11
00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.760
So Min, it seems you didn't go to a salon today.

12
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.729
Seok Jin, what do you mean? Look at my thick makeup.

13
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.100
- Your makeup is thick? - You have makeup on?

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.069
- Yes. - The hat. Did you wash your hair?

15
00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:34.069
Didn't actors in "The Age of Shadows" wear it?

16
00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:36.170
Do people wear this kind of hat these days?

17
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.910
- Jun Jin used to wear this. - Really?

18
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.270
Jin used to wear this kind of hat a lot.

19
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.639
- Kye Sang wore this kind of hat. - That's right.

20
00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:43.850
- Members of g.o.d wore it a lot. - It was when they sang "Road".

21
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.310
- It was when they sang "Road". - Exactly.

22
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.920
No, Jang Hyuk wore it first.

23
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350
- Do you remember that? - Remember what?

24
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.520
- On Ryu Hyun Jin's wedding day... - I don't remember, Seok Jin.

25
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.990
Why can't you remember?

26
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.459
- Don't interrupt me. Why not? - I don't remember.

27
00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:56.259
- Why are you interrupting me? - I don't remember.

28
00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:57.889
Don't stop me. This is important.

29
00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:59.700
- I don't remember the day. - You remember, Ji Hyo, right?

30
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.329
- You already talked about that. - Come again?

31
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.399
- What do you mean? - He already talked about it.

32
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.370
- When did I talk about it? - You talked about it last week.

33
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.999
- I talked about this? - You mentioned it last week.

34
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.700
- Are you sure? - You two talked about it.

35
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.570
Seok Jin, you talked about it during the opening segment.

36
00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:10.840
I see.

37
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.739
What's happening with him?

38
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.010
Seok Jin is flustered now.

39
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.079
There must be an eraser in his head.

40
00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:18.510
He's developing a new character. Seok Jin, player of the gate ball.

41
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.510
"Gate ball"?

42
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.820
(Play gate ball, and live a long, healthy life.)

43
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.090
Today, to celebrate the new year and in light of our wish for you...

44
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.359
to turn over a new leaf through missions, we prepared our race.

45
00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.129
The race is Along with the New.

46
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.329
- "Along with the Gods" is popular. - "Along with the Gods".

47
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.900
- Someone might die today. - Someone...

48
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.239
- No, someone will get superpower. - Is that it?

49
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:42.599
- Don't talk about death. - Hey, by the way...

50
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.439
- It's not that. - I can't help but look at you.

51
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.439
(He chokes up.)

52
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.879
- Hey. - I end up looking at you.

53
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.079
- Seok Jin, stop it. - Yes, stop.

54
00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.079
All is fair when it's about death.

55
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.010
- Don't talk about dying. - Promise me that you won't die.

56
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.019
(Promise me that you won't die.)

57
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.849
- I won't die. - Please, Seok Jin.

58
00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.090
- I'm not going to die. - The order...

59
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.450
"I won't die."

60
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.260
Why do you think that I'm going to die?

61
00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.230
No, I won't. I'm still healthy.

62
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.489
I don't even take health supplements despite my age.

63
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.729
- That's why you should take some. - Take some supplements.

64
00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.199
- Take supplements. - Drop the act. Don't let it worsen.

65
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.469
- When you get old, - Right.

66
00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.099
going to clinics should be part of your routine.

67
00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.999
Stop it. That's enough.

68
00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.110
I'm serious.

69
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.909
Before you start your race today, there is...

70
00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.680
- a mission to get Chance Cards. - Really?

71
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.379
We'll proceed with Along with a Spending Spree.

72
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.919
(Mission to gain Chance Cards, Along with a Spending Spree)

73
00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.789
You won't get a lunch break today.

74
00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.689
Starting now, you'll have your lunch.

75
00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.390
Come up with an order after discussing among yourselves.

76
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.890
You need to buy food from the rest area within...

77
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.030
- 20-dollar budget in a relay. - In a relay?

78
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.999
If everyone buys a dish, the mission is successful.

79
00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.629
If you accomplish your mission, only one member will be...

80
00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.640
- given a special Chance Card. - A Chance Card?

81
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.270
If you fail the mission, one of the members will face a punishment.

82
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.280
From the start?

83
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.479
This sounds like it's about loyalty.

84
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.349
Isn't the probability to fail about 90 percent?

85
00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.180
It's about 99.9 percent.

86
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.650
I think Se Chan and Kwang Soo should go last.

87
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.689
- No, I won't betray you. - Se Chan and Kwang Soo should.

88
00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.990
- Se Chan does unexpected things. - Yes, he does.

89
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.860
- I do that when it's about money. - That's right.

90
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.330
Se Chan should be consistent with his character.

91
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.599
He should be either loyal or traitorous. He acts differently.

92
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.840
Se Chan would keep changing his sides and get nothing in the end.

93
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.999
I tend to change my side.

94
00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.310
- He's involved in both teams. - I'm in both teams.

95
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.340
- We should decide the order. - Yes, let's do that.

96
00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.110
Should we play the timing game?

97
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.379
- 1. - 2.

98
00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.419
(They will go 7th and 8th.)

99
00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.979
- It's them. - You two will go last.

100
00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.419
- You will go last. - Both of you will go last.

101
00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.050
- What are you doing? - You'll go last.

102
00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.590
The rest of us should play the timing game.

103
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.419
- One. - Both of you are out.

104
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.460
(Haha and Jong Kook will go 5th and 6th.)

105
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.490
Go over there.

106
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.499
Move down. Ji Hyo, come here.

107
00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.599
- I can win by not doing anything. - This is nice.

108
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.870
- You must do nothing to win. - All right.

109
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.669
The four of us can play the game now.

110
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.340
I guess we are inseparable, right?

111
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.240
- Right? - This is great. I like the order.

112
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.669
- Get ready. - What are we playing?

113
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.740
- The timing game. - I can win if I don't do anything.

114
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.050
- 1. - 2.

115
00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:04.280
Three.

116
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.379
(You fools. I can win this game if I don't do anything.)

117
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.289
(What?)

118
00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:12.819
- Move down. - This is weird.

119
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.560
- Move down. - Move to this side.

120
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.460
- Ji Hyo, sit in the third seat. - You're not motivated at all.

121
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.590
- Come here. - Move down.

122
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.489
This is weird. I should've won since I did nothing.

123
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.099
If you do nothing, you'll become a pushover.

124
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.200
Is there a hat festival today?

125
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.739
- One. - We didn't start yet.

126
00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:27.969
We just started.

127
00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.169
- I have to say, "Start". - You said, "Start".

128
00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.239
Start when I say the word.

129
00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:32.510
You're quick since you look like Jun Jin.

130
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.210
- She's quick. - She's the fastest.

131
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.710
All right. Start.

132
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.710
One.

133
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.450
Two.

134
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.250
- 1. - 2.

135
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.890
(So Min loses just like Seok Jin.)

136
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.489
- Jin, come here. - Move.

137
00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:46.789
- Jin, come here. - Move down here.

138
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.489
I will get to eat though.

139
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.190
Hey, move down. Get out of here.

140
00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.390
- I will get a turn, right? Ji Hyo. - Move down.

141
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.059
Ji Hyo and I should play rock-paper-scissors.

142
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.700
Rock-paper-scissors

143
00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.099
(Jae Seok will go 1st.)

144
00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.200
- I'll go first. - Gosh.

145
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.469
I have a bad feeling about Jae Seok.

146
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.799
Okay!

147
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.109
- Jae Seok shouldn't go first. - Okay.

148
00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:07.609
Hey, don't you know me? I don't...

149
00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:09.979
- You like to spend money. - I'm quite sensible.

150
00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.609
- You can spend up to 3 dollars. - Spend only 2 dollars and 50 cents.

151
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:14.250
- Only spend three dollars. - Jae Seok.

152
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.020
I will eat moderately.

153
00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:18.390
Is today's special about test-takers?

154
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.190
(Is today's special about test-takers?)

155
00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.359
- Seriously? Okay, fine. - Look at him.

156
00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:24.429
- I see how it is. I got it. - Your outfit is horrible.

157
00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:26.090
I see. You pointed at me.

158
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.599
- I got it. - Okay.

159
00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:29.799
- I changed my mind. - What's your color coordination?

160
00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:31.969
I didn't change my outfit because I was lazy.

161
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.799
- Buy your food, and bring it here. - Jae Seok.

162
00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:36.510
Just have ramyeon. That's neat.

163
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.739
I had breakfast before coming here,

164
00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.109
so I can't eat a lot.

165
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.909
You can't eat a lot.

166
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.010
- You had breakfast? - I had breakfast.

167
00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:45.109
- I don't overeat. - Jae Seok.

168
00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:47.619
- Let's be reasonable. - Don't you worry.

169
00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:50.219
- People don't want us to overdo it. - Don't worry.

170
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:51.950
- Hey, viewers hate it the most... - Did I upset him?

171
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.789
- when they can't understand us. - Right. They must understand us.

172
00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:54.859
- That's right. - Okay.

173
00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:56.690
I really had breakfast.

174
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.530
(Will he make a reasonable decision?)

175
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.859
What should I eat?

176
00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:01.630
- Hello. - Hi.

177
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.000
(He passes by the food that gives off tempting smell...)

178
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.270
(and arrives at the food court.)

179
00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:08.739
There are a lot of delicious dishes.

180
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.340
What should I eat?

181
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.179
That...

182
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.809
(Jae Seok is entranced by the menu.)

183
00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.250
I really want to eat seafood soft tofu stew.

184
00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:17.609
Then I will have...

185
00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:20.619
(Which dish did he choose after contemplating?)

186
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.349
- A dollar. - After looking at the order,

187
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.950
I won't be able to eat.

188
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.950
- I'm not sure about So Min. - So Min...

189
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.320
I'll just have a bowl of udon.

190
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.659
- That's five dollars. - Please let me have udon.

191
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.590
What's taking him so long? Which dish did he choose?

192
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.599
- He must have ordered a main dish. - Why is he taking so long?

193
00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:37.099
(He starts talking out of the blue.)

194
00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.799
Just buy fishcake on a stick. Hey, buy a small dish.

195
00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.640
(What?)

196
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640
(Whom is he talking to?)

197
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.239
- There's no one there. - We are at a rest area.

198
00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.510
- Seok Jin, no one's there. - Really?

199
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.710
- Whom are you talking to? - You did that on purpose, right?

200
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.809
No one is there, Seok Jin.

201
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:52.979
I thought he was talking to the Grim Reaper.

202
00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.450
Seok Jin, promise me that you won't die.

203
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.289
- Get a grip. Get yourself together. - That surprised me.

204
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.090
We are at a rest area.

205
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.289
- You startled me. - He talked to the empty space.

206
00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:01.989
- I didn't look at that side. - Whom was he talking to?

207
00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:03.059
- I didn't see... - No one was there.

208
00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:05.559
I didn't look there, but rest areas always serve fishcake on a stick.

209
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.900
- Why don't they have it here? - Sorry?

210
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400
He's back.

211
00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:11.429
- Jae Seok is back. - He's coming back.

212
00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:12.729
- What did he bring? - He has soup.

213
00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:13.739
What is he bringing?

214
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.340
- That's good. - That's not that bad.

215
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.609
- That's pretty good. - That's great.

216
00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:18.969
- How much was it? - How much?

217
00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:20.479
- Jae Seok. - That looks delicious.

218
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:22.380
- Right? - Give Ji Hyo the rest of money.

219
00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:24.450
(Jae Seok chooses jjajangmyeon.)

220
00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.349
- How much was it? - How much?

221
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.679
- Jae Seok, how much was it? - It must be 4 or 5 dollars.

222
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.890
Ji Hyo, take the money, and go.

223
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.890
- How much was it? - Take it, and go.

224
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.489
- I'll be back. - Don't show it. Pick what you want.

225
00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:38.890
- Okay. - What kind of food do they have?

226
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.330
- Are there a lot? - They serve every kind of food.

227
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.799
You sprinkled chili powder.

228
00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:44.500
You bet.

229
00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:46.200
That looks really good. It's steaming.

230
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.900
No, Jae Seok.

231
00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:51.409
- He's going to slurp. - My gosh.

232
00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.809
- Right? My gosh. - Goodness.

233
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:55.539
You won't be hungry for the whole day, Jae Seok.

234
00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.609
When he eats noodles, his slurping sounds really tasty.

235
00:07:58.609 --> 00:08:00.349
The shape of his mouth is cute.

236
00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:03.390
When viewers watch this, some of them will order jjajangmyeon.

237
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.919
I agree. He's enjoying jjajangmyeon more than usual.

238
00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:08.659
To be honest, I had breakfast before coming here.

239
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.559
I'm going to eat some snacks.

240
00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:13.260
I want to eat tteokbokki. It's three dollars.

241
00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:15.059
That's expensive.

242
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.729
(Which dish did she choose?)

243
00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:18.599
If everyone chooses a two-dollar dish,

244
00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.739
- Right. - it'd be a happy ending.

245
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.609
Let's buy cheap dishes, so Jae Seok looks selfish.

246
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:26.070
It's really hot.

247
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.179
- Then... - What did you buy?

248
00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:29.280
- What is that? - What did you buy?

249
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.349
- That's so nice of you. - She's so nice.

250
00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:33.419
Ji Hyo. I bet that only cost a dollar.

251
00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:34.720
(Ji Hyo chooses...)

252
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.980
(garaetteok.)

253
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.049
That's garaetteok.

254
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:39.919
Ji Hyo, will this be enough for your lunch?

255
00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:41.959
- What's this? - Goodness, Ji Hyo.

256
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.089
What are you doing? That's mine!

257
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:45.630
- That's mine. - Stop that, Seok Jin.

258
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.860
(Seok Jin steals garaetteok.)

259
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.500
- What are you doing? - Hey! Shoot.

260
00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.069
She gave me the green light that I can take it.

261
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.699
- Really? - No. Ji Hyo didn't do that.

262
00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.539
- You gave me the green light. - When did I do that?

263
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.709
- You took it and split it. - Seriously?

264
00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.339
- Seok Jin. - Can he do that?

265
00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:02.909
- I apologize on his behalf. - I bet you'll do the right thing.

266
00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.010
I'm off now.

267
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.750
- Be back soon. - I'll be back.

268
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.549
I really want to eat udon.

269
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.949
(So Min only wanted to eat udon.)

270
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:12.049
What should I do?

271
00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:13.260
(Thinking)

272
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.860
"Udon". I want udon.

273
00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:21.600
Actually, I suffered from the flu and gastritis a few days ago,

274
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.400
so I didn't get to eat anything for a week.

275
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.569
I don't even have eggs at home.

276
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.699
I want to eat pork cutlet and udon, but I can only eat one, right?

277
00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:33.339
(She can only choose one. Which dish did So Min choose?)

278
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.280
When I calculated the prices, it's about 4 dollars and 50 cents.

279
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.110
No. Jae Seok's dish costs over four dollars.

280
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.319
- Let's say it's about 5 dollars. - 5 dollars.

281
00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:43.620
- Then it's 8 dollars already. - This must be 2 dollars.

282
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.559
You need to think about why...

283
00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:49.860
the production crew set the limit at 20 dollars.

284
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.789
The games don't pop out of nowhere.

285
00:09:51.789 --> 00:09:53.329
They are actually played at research center.

286
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:54.500
Is there a research center?

287
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:57.669
There are staff members who play eight of us.

288
00:09:57.669 --> 00:09:58.730
Did you know that?

289
00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:00.669
Through simulations...

290
00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:02.939
Then the person who plays me must be hot-headed.

291
00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:04.240
That person...

292
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.740
He comes out of prison...

293
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.209
(He comes out of the prison...)

294
00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.250
He comes just for the simulations of the games.

295
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.980
That actor was replaced many times.

296
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.250
- Really? - Yes.

297
00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:17.089
- The actor can be replaced. - It has happened many times.

298
00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:18.520
- Really? - Yes.

299
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.659
It's not easy to play me.

300
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.990
What's taking So Min so long?

301
00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:24.789
Is So Min back?

302
00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:26.760
- There she comes. - She is back.

303
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.630
- A hat from "The Age of Shadows". - Kim Tak Goo.

304
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.730
There she comes.

305
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.230
There comes Kim Tak Goo.

306
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.699
- What do you have? - How many dishes did she buy?

307
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.900
- How many dishes did you buy? - I only ordered udon.

308
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.439
She gave me pork cutlet for free.

309
00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:40.409
(Udon...)

310
00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:42.740
(and pork cutlet?)

311
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.949
She asked, "You are Jeon So Min, right?"

312
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:46.480
"Please take this."

313
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.980
Don't lie.

314
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.919
Are you saying it was given for free?

315
00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.789
Yes. I only ordered udon.

316
00:10:52.789 --> 00:10:55.220
The employee said the pork cutlet is a wrong order.

317
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.260
There is no way you got that big pork cutlet for free.

318
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.429
The pork cutlet is the main dish.

319
00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:01.299
- No, it's not. - That doesn't make any sense.

320
00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:02.600
Udon usually isn't served...

321
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.530
- in that dish. - That's an earthen pot.

322
00:11:04.669 --> 00:11:06.400
We are counting on you, Seok Jin.

323
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.569
Seok Jin.

324
00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:09.169
- We have a good chance. - That's right.

325
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.169
I didn't get a lot of money.

326
00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:13.809
We can make it work.

327
00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:16.549
I only have small bills, too.

328
00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:18.480
So Min.

329
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.620
You know,

330
00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:21.720
I wanted to share with everyone.

331
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.220
Kim Tak Goo, make sure you eat everything.

332
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.189
I don't even have eggs at home.

333
00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:27.419
(She tries to make the members feel sorry for her.)

334
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:28.620
You live alone.

335
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.490
I am sure she doesn't want to eat this much.

336
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.659
I am sure she doesn't want to eat this much.

337
00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.299
She did it to be funny.

338
00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:36.569
She did it to be funny.

339
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.230
I should think of it as a joke.

340
00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.400
It's a variety show, after all.

341
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.169
I can't believe she did that.

342
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.240
My heart is pounding right now.

343
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.439
Before a fight,

344
00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:50.679
elementary school students' heart pound.

345
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.449
I wouldn't say it happens before a fight.

346
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.880
It happens before a beating.

347
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.250
So Min, eat up. You really wanted those dishes.

348
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.689
Jong Kook, my heart is pounding.

349
00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:01.319
I bet my fortune...

350
00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:04.130
that Jong Kook will make So Min cry in two months.

351
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.589
- It will happen in 2 months. - It won't happen in 2 months.

352
00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:06.929
It will happen today.

353
00:12:06.929 --> 00:12:08.929
So Min's dad will call Jong Kook.

354
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.530
"Jong Kook, I apologize."

355
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.100
(I am sure So Min did it to be funny.)

356
00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:16.510
I can't believe So Min.

357
00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:20.880
I got a dollar and 50 cents.

358
00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:24.079
(Does that mean 3 people spent 18 dollars and 50 cents?)

359
00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:27.049
There are eight of us.

360
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.319
Not everyone will be able to eat.

361
00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:29.720
Not everyone will be able to eat.

362
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.890
Please give me jjajangmyeon.

363
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.350
(Jae Seok ordered a 6-dollar jjajangmyeon.)

364
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.819
Please give me garaetteok.

365
00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.890
(Ji Hyo, who wasn't hungry, ordered a 2-dollar garaetteok.)

366
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.530
Please give me a pork cutlet and udon set.

367
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.929
(So Min ordered a dish that costs a 10 dollar and 50 cent.)

368
00:12:39.929 --> 00:12:41.329
(Worried)

369
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:44.199
Seok Jin will be able to eat, right?

370
00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:46.339
(The change is a dollar and 50 cents.)

371
00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:49.299
What will I eat with this money?

372
00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:51.270
(What is Seok Jin's decision?)

373
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.640
Seok Jin!

374
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.339
He is nice.

375
00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:56.949
- Really? - He is nice.

376
00:12:57.709 --> 00:12:59.549
- He bought red bean jelly. - He is really nice.

377
00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:00.650
Did you buy red bean jelly?

378
00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:04.250
The current situation left me with no choice.

379
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.350
Really?

380
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:08.089
- The current situation? - What does that mean?

381
00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:10.130
- Seok Jin, what happened? - Give me the change.

382
00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:15.199
(My goodness.)

383
00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:17.669
There should be at least 10 dollars left.

384
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.270
Jong Kook, get going.

385
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.699
(She feels like she is chewing sand.)

386
00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:22.839
All right.

387
00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:24.569
(Jong Kook leaves with 60 cents.)

388
00:13:24.939 --> 00:13:26.039
Jong Kook.

389
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.640
For goodness' sake!

390
00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:29.980
I can't believe Jong Kook!

391
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.880
(She throws punches as soon as Jong Kook leaves.)

392
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.079
I can't believe Jong Kook!

393
00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:36.650
For goodness' sake!

394
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:40.819
Kim Jong Kook!

395
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.130
Ji Hyo did this in the past.

396
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.329
- Ji Hyo. - The past is repeating itself.

397
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.559
I will rip Jong Kook's name tag and get eliminated.

398
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.669
Hey! Be quiet!

399
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.270
(So Min is like the delinquent version of Ji Hyo...)

400
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.409
(that was often brought out due to Jong Kook's cool-headedness.)

401
00:13:56.409 --> 00:13:58.409
Ji Hyo, I am so upset.

402
00:13:58.409 --> 00:13:59.640
- Seriously. - I understand.

403
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:02.439
You have a long way to go.

404
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.650
Have you sworn at Jong Kook?

405
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.780
Of course I have.

406
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.819
- There he comes. - He is back.

407
00:14:07.819 --> 00:14:09.079
I think he bought a soda.

408
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.220
Am I wrong?

409
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.559
- No, he didn't. - He didn't.

410
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:17.760
Seok Jin, please.

411
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.829
Stop imagining things.

412
00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.459
You need to be careful.

413
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.230
Is the person with the soda holding a scythe by any chance?

414
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.299
(Seok Jin, it's time to go.)

415
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.909
Stop it!

416
00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:33.539
(Don't follow a stranger.)

417
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.510
He is back. He is back.

418
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.309
Your steps are light.

419
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.880
Of course they are.

420
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.120
I don't have much in my pockets.

421
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.220
You don't?

422
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.449
Didn't you buy anything?

423
00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.720
- Didn't you buy anything? - I did.

424
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.390
You bought gum.

425
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.620
- Really? - How much money do we have left?

426
00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:50.360
Was the change enough to buy gum?

427
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.789
(He gives Haha the change.)

428
00:14:52.789 --> 00:14:53.929
What is this?

429
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.500
(He gets 10 cents.)

430
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.199
- He brought food. - Did he bring food?

431
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:02.699
For goodness' sake.

432
00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.870
- Really? - It's better to eat.

433
00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:07.179
- Is that all? - Thus,

434
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.409
the mission fails since you spent over 20 dollars.

435
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:12.780
Se Chan and Kwang Soo won't be able to eat.

436
00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:16.549
Why did you set the limit to 20 dollars?

437
00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:19.250
It's not the matter of the limit. How much did you have?

438
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.459
I had 10 cents.

439
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.059
(I see.)

440
00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:23.890
I thought you would have 50 cents.

441
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.400
So Min's dish...

442
00:15:26.699 --> 00:15:28.559
- is the most expensive. - In the entire rest area, right?

443
00:15:28.659 --> 00:15:31.870
It's the most expensive dish in the entire rest area.

444
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.169
It couldn't have been a random choice.

445
00:15:33.169 --> 00:15:34.400
I will take a piece of gum as a dessert.

446
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.470
(It's the gum Jong Kook bought.)

447
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.669
It's dessert.

448
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:37.770
(Eat up, So Min.)

449
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.909
Everyone got to eat something...

450
00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:42.740
except for you and me.

451
00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:45.980
I drank two bottles of water...

452
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.079
- because my throat went dry. - Me, too.

453
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.949
I finished my bottle of water.

454
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.390
Along with a Spending Spree...

455
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.520
was a failure since you spent more than 20 dollars.

456
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.260
One of you will get Penalty Card.

457
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.159
The person with this card will get a penalty no matter what.

458
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.559
It's a game of chance.

459
00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.000
- How will we decide? - There is a container of spoons.

460
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.370
That's how a member will be chosen.

461
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.939
(The container has spoons with the numbers from 1 to 8.)

462
00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:10.510
The worst-case scenario is Jong Kook getting the Penalty Card.

463
00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:13.839
The worst-case scenario is Jong Kook getting the Penalty Card.

464
00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.939
Give me the penalty instead!

465
00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:17.110
Spare Jong Kook.

466
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.579
That would be the worst.

467
00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:21.919
He will visit So Min in her dream.

468
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.390
- Pick a number. - Let's go...

469
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.150
- Let's go with four. - That's the unlucky number.

470
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:28.360
Let's go with four.

471
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.089
The person who gets four will receive the penalty.

472
00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.130
Okay.

473
00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:32.760
Don't look.

474
00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:34.500
It will be incredible if he gets four.

475
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.730
Yes, it will be incredible if he gets four.

476
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.740
(Being the unlucky one, Kwang Soo may choose four.)

477
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.740
4! 4!

478
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.470
- Show us right away. - 4! 4!

479
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.110
- It's three. - Okay.

480
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.780
(Kwang Soo avoids the penalty.)

481
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.409
(That's too bad.)

482
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:54.120
If no one gets it before it's Jong Kook's turn...

483
00:16:54.549 --> 00:16:55.850
Imagine if I picked four.

484
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.650
(He picks 6 and avoids the penalty.)

485
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.620
- 6! Okay! - Everyone, 4 should go...

486
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.829
(Not knowing what the penalty is makes them nervous.)

487
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:05.059
So Min.

488
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
You are done for if Jong Kook picks four.

489
00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:11.369
Then the real nightmare will begin.

490
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.069
Five!

491
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.240
(He picks 5 and survives.)

492
00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:15.740
My goodness.

493
00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.339
My goodness.

494
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.940
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

495
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.450
(The container passes by the unluckiest ones.)

496
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.480
Everyone.

497
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.649
Look at this.

498
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.950
The numbers that were picked are 3, 5, and 6.

499
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.420
Four will complete the sequence.

500
00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:33.260
My goodness.

501
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.059
It's the empty spot.

502
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.660
- Four is the empty spot. - It's the empty spot.

503
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.230
- If Jong Kook picks 4... - Jong Kook, pick 4.

504
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:40.930
My goodness.

505
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.030
The envelope is black, your favorite color.

506
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.799
- This is unbelievable. - Pick four.

507
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.399
- If I pick 4... - Pick 4.

508
00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.399
The spirit of variety shows is on your side.

509
00:17:49.399 --> 00:17:51.109
(Jong Kook picks the fourth spoon.)

510
00:17:51.109 --> 00:17:52.539
- So Min. - So Min, pray.

511
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.980
- So Min, pray. - Four.

512
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.379
- So Min. - So Min, pray.

513
00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:56.609
- So Min, pray. - Four.

514
00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:57.849
Show us.

515
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.980
It's four!

516
00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.349
(He gets goosebumps.)

517
00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:06.889
(The unthinkable happens.)

518
00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:09.829
(The members and the staff are shocked.)

519
00:18:09.859 --> 00:18:12.930
(Furious Jong Kook warning is issued.)

520
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.059
(What should I do?)

521
00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:16.200
So Min!

522
00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:18.270
This is a disaster!

523
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.240
- Did he really pick four? - How did this happen?

524
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.799
- I got goosebumps. - This is it.

525
00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.809
3, 4, 5, 6. You filled the empty spot.

526
00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:25.970
I filled the empty spot.

527
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.240
So Min will feel so uncomfortable today.

528
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.379
So Min's face went pale.

529
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:34.250
She will feel more uncomfortable when the penalty is revealed.

530
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.750
We will move to the next location for Three People Race.

531
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.059
- Okay. - Let's go.

532
00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:41.859
(What is the ending of this ridiculous drama?)

533
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.660
It's a miraculous day.

534
00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:47.260
The chemistry between the national siblings shine.

535
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.770
That's why I am sitting between them.

536
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.000
(That's why I am sitting between them.)

537
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.970
(Jae Seok is my shield.)

538
00:18:57.309 --> 00:18:59.980
Before we reach the next location,

539
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.780
you will have a mission to win the Chance Card...

540
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.379
since you already took the Penalty Card.

541
00:19:03.379 --> 00:19:04.510
(It's a mission to win a Chance Card.)

542
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:06.579
It's called Pinocchio's Answer.

543
00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:08.180
- Pinocchio's Answer? - Is it about lying?

544
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.149
Answer the producer's three question...

545
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.920
with lies in three seconds.

546
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.619
One of the members who succeed...

547
00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.589
will receive the Chance Card.

548
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.889
You know each other pretty well.

549
00:19:17.889 --> 00:19:21.099
If you think a member is telling the truth,

550
00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:23.270
blow the whistle.

551
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.829
Who wants to go first?

552
00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:26.440
- I will go first. - Seok Jin will go first.

553
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.339
- Get ready. - Okay.

554
00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:29.940
Let's go.

555
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.210
What's your real name?

556
00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.740
Jee Seok Jin.

557
00:19:32.879 --> 00:19:35.180
(What?)

558
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.379
You're supposed to lie.

559
00:19:37.379 --> 00:19:38.780
- It's so hard. - You should've said, "Ji Seok Sam".

560
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.849
- You should've said, "Seok Sam". - You're right.

561
00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:42.420
- It's not that easy. - Gosh.

562
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.690
- It's hard. - We're...

563
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.190
- launching a new game right now. - I know.

564
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.589
You should have started it right.

565
00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:52.260
- Let's see how good you are. - This is a launch party.

566
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.660
Let's see how good you are.

567
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.629
You shouldn't launch the game this way.

568
00:19:56.629 --> 00:19:57.970
I'll watch you.

569
00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.399
Why did you ruin everything?

570
00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:01.599
No one came to our launch party.

571
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.940
- Watch, and learn from me. - Ready.

572
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.539
Start. What do you do first thing in the morning?

573
00:20:07.109 --> 00:20:08.410
Goodness...

574
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.180
(Goodness)

575
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:14.349
- Jae Seok. - What's different from Seok Jin?

576
00:20:14.349 --> 00:20:15.920
Can't I say that?

577
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.619
- Say your answer right away. - Can't I?

578
00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:19.589
- Say it right away. - All right.

579
00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:21.089
I didn't know.

580
00:20:21.089 --> 00:20:22.119
I get it.

581
00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.589
- Let's try again. Ready. - Okay.

582
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.059
Start. How much do you weigh?

583
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.059
I weigh 102kg.

584
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.670
Who do you talk to on the phone most often?

585
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:33.970
- See? - Well...

586
00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:37.069
Hey, why can't you say, "Angelina Jolie"?

587
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.440
- That'd be okay, right? - "I weigh 102kg" was weird too.

588
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.809
- He didn't have to say that. - Okay.

589
00:20:42.139 --> 00:20:43.579
I get it. You try.

590
00:20:43.579 --> 00:20:47.180
Okay. I'm good at this kind of game.

591
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.450
- Let's try. - Okay.

592
00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:51.250
Start. Do you like So Min?

593
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.889
No... Yes.

594
00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.789
What do you call your girlfriend?

595
00:20:57.329 --> 00:20:58.359
Honey.

596
00:20:58.359 --> 00:21:00.129
See?

597
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.799
(Honey)

598
00:21:03.069 --> 00:21:05.799
- Honey. - You do call her honey.

599
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.740
Why can't you say, "Bear Paw"?

600
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.010
(Coaching)

601
00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:14.510
- What? - What are you saying?

602
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.809
If I play like you...

603
00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.480
- What is he saying? - You're bad too.

604
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.180
After doing such a bad job, what are you saying?

605
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.250
Why is it so hard?

606
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.920
- Haha, try. - Gosh.

607
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.619
Ready, start. What comes to your mind when you see Jong Kook?

608
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.530
I want to kill him. Hold on.

609
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.230
You mean it.

610
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.599
I was lying.

611
00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:37.170
It's not a lie.

612
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.030
- I was lying. - He even said it to me once.

613
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.069
- Really? - Hold on.

614
00:21:41.069 --> 00:21:42.539
- He doesn't understand the game. - No.

615
00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:44.069
- I was lying. - He meant it.

616
00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:45.270
He meant it.

617
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.109
Ji Hyo, try.

618
00:21:47.109 --> 00:21:48.910
- Ji Hyo, let's try. - Good luck.

619
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.149
Ready, start.

620
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:52.210
What is your real name?

621
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.819
Kim Jong Kook.

622
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.280
Who are you most uncomfortable with among the members?

623
00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:58.520
Kim Jong Kook.

624
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.059
That's true.

625
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.889
- That's true. - Why did you tell the truth?

626
00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:05.589
- Hold on. - Why...

627
00:22:05.589 --> 00:22:07.200
Every time someone says something about me...

628
00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:10.599
- Why did she say, "Jong Kook"? - Why is it true every time?

629
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.799
You said, "Jong Kook", both times.

630
00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.170
- What's going on? - Jong Kook just said,

631
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.740
"Why is it true every time someone says something about me?"

632
00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:20.440
It might be a lie.

633
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.839
- But it's true. - It might be a lie.

634
00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:24.980
- Jong Kook should try. - Try.

635
00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:26.180
I'll only tell lies.

636
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.049
- Ready, start. - Okay.

637
00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:29.750
- Your best body part? - Neck.

638
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.690
- Your favorite, Haha or Se Chan? - Se Chan.

639
00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.389
You have a girlfriend hidden in the US, right?

640
00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:38.660
- Se Chan... - Yes.

641
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.530
After all the things I've done...

642
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:41.799
Hold on.

643
00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:43.329
He didn't even hesitate.

644
00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:45.170
- He didn't even hesitate. - No one blew the whistle.

645
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.500
I wanted to blow the whistle,

646
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.470
but everyone else was quiet.

647
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.639
I got hurt.

648
00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:53.339
What have I done for the past year?

649
00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:54.940
I've been taking care of him for the past year.

650
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.280
Haha looks so happy.

651
00:22:58.149 --> 00:23:00.319
- I like it. - I lied.

652
00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:01.849
- I was going to blow the whistle. - Give him the last question.

653
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:03.289
If he succeeds, he'll win a Chance Card.

654
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.420
I did ask the last question, but let me ask another one.

655
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.990
- Okay. - Ready, start.

656
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.889
- Who is the most beautiful actress? - Ji Hyo.

657
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.629
(This is tricky.)

658
00:23:14.629 --> 00:23:15.799
(It's true.)

659
00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.700
It's true.

660
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.970
Why is it true?

661
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.670
It's not true.

662
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.200
Something's bothering me.

663
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.010
- I've seen beautiful actresses. - We're just playing a game,

664
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.079
but why do you say each other's name?

665
00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:30.609
It's because she's in my sight right now.

666
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.379
So is So Min.

667
00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:34.520
Do you think I would want to say her name right now?

668
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.549
(Do you think I would want to say her name right now?)

669
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:40.119
- Even if it's a lie... - Not today.

670
00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:42.460
Who do you want to give a second chance?

671
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.490
I don't think they were fair to me.

672
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.129
Give Haha another chance.

673
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.559
Ready, start.

674
00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:49.569
How tall are you?

675
00:23:49.569 --> 00:23:50.869
203cm.

676
00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:52.770
Who is your favorite, Jae Seok or Jong Kook?

677
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.639
(Who is your favorite, Jae Seok or Jong Kook?)

678
00:23:56.639 --> 00:23:57.970
Jong Kook.

679
00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.180
Hold on.

680
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.309
(Jong Kook gets hurt and hits Haha.)

681
00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:07.680
- Hold on. - Jong Kook.

682
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.250
- It's not like that. - This is how I felt.

683
00:24:10.389 --> 00:24:11.950
- I felt this way too. - Hold on.

684
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.589
That's how I felt.

685
00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:17.889
- It's not like that. - That was funny.

686
00:24:17.889 --> 00:24:19.430
- Jae Seok is older. - That was funny.

687
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.859
You're sitting next to me.

688
00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:23.569
Why don't you let Kwang Soo try again?

689
00:24:23.569 --> 00:24:25.170
- He's good. - Let him try again.

690
00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:26.639
- He's good. - Jong Kook...

691
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:28.839
(Please ask the same question.)

692
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.010
- Give me a question. - Next.

693
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:34.710
In your life...

694
00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:40.420
(In your life...)

695
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.280
Who's your favorite, Jae Seok or Jong Kook?

696
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.190
Jong Kook.

697
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.589
(He thought it'd be a different question,)

698
00:24:48.589 --> 00:24:50.329
(but it was the same.)

699
00:24:50.329 --> 00:24:52.629
(He gave the same answer.)

700
00:24:52.629 --> 00:24:55.160
(He blows the whistle.)

701
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.329
(Do you hear the whistle? I really like Jong Kook better.)

702
00:24:58.329 --> 00:25:00.339
Both times...

703
00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:01.899
I can't believe you.

704
00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:03.839
Think of all the things Jong Kook has done for you.

705
00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:05.770
- That question was weird. - You're so ungrateful.

706
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.180
I blew the whistle.

707
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.680
Ask the same question to Se Chan.

708
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.149
This is your last year anyway.

709
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:14.079
I blew the whistle.

710
00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:17.349
- This is your last year. - I blew the whistle.

711
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:19.220
(Laughing)

712
00:25:19.289 --> 00:25:21.990
- The sound was so loud. - It was.

713
00:25:22.089 --> 00:25:24.089
It sounded like you crushed a watermelon.

714
00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:27.200
Why would you exaggerate so much?

715
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.200
How many people are you fighting with?

716
00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:31.399
It didn't sound like that.

717
00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:33.770
- Do you want to hear that sound? - He's a fighting cock.

718
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.170
He's a fighting cock.

719
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.309
He really is a fighting cock.

720
00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:40.940
He really is a fighting cock.

721
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.639
He's picking fights...

722
00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:44.149
A fighting cock?

723
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:47.349
Kwang Soo said it first.

724
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.180
- I said it quietly. - This is so funny.

725
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.450
- A fighting cock? - He said it first.

726
00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:53.319
- I didn't say it, Kwang Soo did. - I can't believe it.

727
00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:55.889
Do you know what's really scary?

728
00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.889
Seok Jin isn't saying anything.

729
00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:59.490
(He isn't saying a word.)

730
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.069
He doesn't want to get in trouble with Jong Kook.

731
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.530
He's being so quiet.

732
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.399
I should protect my pride.

733
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.099
- I should protect my pride. - Gosh.

734
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.670
Seok Jin is so...

735
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.339
You failed to win Chance Cards.

736
00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:16.910
(Where is this bus...)

737
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.379
(headed?)

738
00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:21.980
- Where are we going? - Okay.

739
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.190
What's that?

740
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:24.520
- Wait. - Oh, my.

741
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.750
- It says, "correction". - It says, "correction".

742
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.059
- Where are we? - What's happening?

743
00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:29.260
What's that?

744
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.190
- We're at a prison. - Hold on.

745
00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:32.460
We're at a prison.

746
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:33.960
Hold on.

747
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.960
At last, you're taking us to a prison?

748
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.200
What's going on?

749
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.170
(The walls isolate the prisoners from the outside world.)

750
00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.240
- For real? - Aren't those prison uniforms?

751
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.770
- Is this "Prison Playbook"? - Are we at a prison?

752
00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.339
Is this really a prison?

753
00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:47.740
- Are we going in? - Are we going in?

754
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.980
(Welcome to Running Prison.)

755
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.710
- Seriously? - By the way,

756
00:26:51.809 --> 00:26:53.379
this place suits Jong Kook very well.

757
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.420
(This place suits Jong Kook.)

758
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:55.819
He deserves to be here.

759
00:26:55.819 --> 00:26:56.849
- What are you saying? - It suits him so well.

760
00:26:56.849 --> 00:26:59.589
- He's finally here. - Think of all your sins.

761
00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:02.389
- That's not true. - Think of all the fights.

762
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:03.660
He's our fighting cock.

763
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.799
As a part of our project, Along with the New,

764
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.829
we came to this place to become new people.

765
00:27:08.829 --> 00:27:11.170
Why would you bring us to a prison?

766
00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.240
Why are we at a prison?

767
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.000
- Before we start the race, - We have to escape?

768
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.139
I'll tell you what crimes you committed in the previous mission.

769
00:27:18.369 --> 00:27:21.609
You'll serve a certain time before you're released as a new person.

770
00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.250
Along with the New, Crime and Punishment.

771
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.980
- We have to serve time? - We have to serve time?

772
00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:28.780
We have to serve a sentence?

773
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.149
Let me tell you what crimes you committed.

774
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.690
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

775
00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:35.020
You committed disorderly conduct by taking off your clothes.

776
00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.829
- That's right. - That's right.

777
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.299
(Does he really have a stylist?)

778
00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:46.440
(Jae Seok suddenly takes off his clothes during the shoot.)

779
00:27:47.639 --> 00:27:53.480
(Jae Seok commits disorderly conduct by taking off his clothes.)

780
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.780
I undressed because I was hot. That's disorderly conduct?

781
00:27:57.079 --> 00:28:00.619
Haha committed defamation by ridiculing Jae Seok's style.

782
00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.190
Seok Jin committed theft by eating Ji Hyo's rice cakes.

783
00:28:05.349 --> 00:28:07.460
We were just sharing it.

784
00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.690
Jong Kook committed verbal violence...

785
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.030
by telling Seok Jin he'd get Alzheimer's.

786
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.399
- That's right. - He deserves it.

787
00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:15.200
- He deserves to go to prison. - He deserves it.

788
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.230
- I knew it. - My goodness.

789
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.639
He committed physical violence by hitting others' heads too.

790
00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:20.899
You committed two crimes.

791
00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:24.670
So Min spent too much money and caused an internal disturbance.

792
00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:26.440
- So Min? - An internal disturbance.

793
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.549
Se Chan committed defamation...

794
00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:32.250
by making fun of Seok Jin.

795
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.649
- Defamation. - Defamation?

796
00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:37.649
Ji Hyo abetted the other members in spending too much money.

797
00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.660
- You abetted the others. - Is that a crime?

798
00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:41.260
Kwang Soo.

799
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.690
I didn't do anything.

800
00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:43.930
- What about Kwang Soo? - Kwang Soo.

801
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.559
I didn't do anything today.

802
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.030
Kwang Soo...

803
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.859
I didn't do anything wrong.

804
00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:50.629
Kwang Soo...

805
00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.440
didn't do anything special. He neglected his duties.

806
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.869
What are you talking about?

807
00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.609
I can't believe this.

808
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.010
This is ridiculous. What are you talking about?

809
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.539
I made you guys laugh so hard.

810
00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:03.349
You neglected your duties.

811
00:29:03.349 --> 00:29:04.649
What are you talking about?

812
00:29:04.649 --> 00:29:06.619
His crime is so trivial.

813
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.450
It's so insignificant.

814
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.849
Hold on.

815
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.389
I committed violence now.

816
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:14.589
It hurt my pride.

817
00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:16.990
He didn't do anything.

818
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.859
Your sentence will be determined now.

819
00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:23.170
Your sentence will be determined randomly...

820
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.829
- by drawing cards. - This is important.

821
00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:28.099
It'll determine how long you'll shoot today.

822
00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.170
- Really? - Really?

823
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.710
- It ranges from 2 hours... - What?

824
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.180
to 12 hours.

825
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.980
- Can we really go home? - Can we really go home?

826
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.549
- Yes. - We can go home?

827
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:38.379
If you pick 2 hours, you can leave in 2 hours.

828
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.950
For Jong Kook's penalty,

829
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.780
it'll be the double of what he picks.

830
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.520
(Jong Kook's penalty will be doubled.)

831
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.289
- Is it 24 hours if he picks 12? - Yes.

832
00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.059
(I need 24 hours)

833
00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:55.059
(He's angry.)

834
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.369
My goodness.

835
00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.329
24 hours

836
00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:00.440
- What are you doing? - I meant...

837
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.940
- 24 hours - What are you doing?

838
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.609
I meant 24 hours...

839
00:30:04.609 --> 00:30:05.609
(What did you say?)

840
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.809
(Do you want to be scolded for 24 hours?)

841
00:30:10.849 --> 00:30:13.149
The person who comes in last...

842
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:15.680
will get self-bathing penalty on top of...

843
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.250
- Self-bathing? - his original sentence.

844
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.920
(The person who comes in last...)

845
00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.460
(will receive an additional self-bathing penalty.)

846
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.200
Pick a card in a random order.

847
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.099
- I pick this one. - I'll take the last one.

848
00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:32.399
- Only show it to your cameraman. - I'll take the last one.

849
00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:33.399
Dong Hwan.

850
00:30:33.399 --> 00:30:34.970
- I have a strong feeling about it. - Do you want to switch?

851
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.309
- Okay. - Is it a secret?

852
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.410
- Let's exchange. - It's a secret.

853
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.879
You may exchange them.

854
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.750
(Why is she smiling?)

855
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.420
Okay.

856
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.559
(Sighing)

857
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.190
It's me.

858
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.059
(What's Jong Kook's sentence?)

859
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:04.700
(It's 12 hours.)

860
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:06.839
(His sentence is 24 hours.)

861
00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:09.869
Gosh, I can't do this.

862
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.740
Jong Kook's sentence is a minimum of four hours...

863
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.410
to a maximum of 24 hours.

864
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:18.649
- By the way... - He looks quite upset.

865
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:19.879
(He doesn't look happy.)

866
00:31:19.879 --> 00:31:21.980
Did he pick 12 hours?

867
00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:24.250
- Did you? - Who picked two hours?

868
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:27.319
- After the shoot, - My friends.

869
00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:28.889
what you should do...

870
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.660
is go abroad that's over five hours away.

871
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.399
Take a plane, okay?

872
00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.170
You'll change into prisoner attire.

873
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.329
Please follow the prison guard's order.

874
00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:40.399
(They enter Running Prison.)

875
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:41.940
- My goodness. - Gosh.

876
00:31:42.339 --> 00:31:44.510
- Thank you. - Where should we go?

877
00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:46.240
- Why would we go to prison... - This is upsetting.

878
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.579
- for stealing some rice cake? - Seriously.

879
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:54.520
(They enter Running Prison at 11am.)

880
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.589
This is a real prison.

881
00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:00.960
It's a real prison.

882
00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.129
It feels strange.

883
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.059
- Seriously. - Isn't this a movie set?

884
00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:07.859
It is.

885
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.170
- Seriously. - I don't want to go inside.

886
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.629
(The place where they're forced into...)

887
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:14.539
- Do we go in? - Is this the dressing room?

888
00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:15.599
Do we really go in?

889
00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:18.639
All I did was eat a pork cutlet set for lunch.

890
00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:20.309
Come this way.

891
00:32:20.309 --> 00:32:22.410
(All members are transferred at 11:10am.)

892
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:23.410
Goodness.

893
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.149
(All members are transferred at 11:10am.)

894
00:32:26.649 --> 00:32:27.649
(Song Ji Hyo)

895
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:31.520
(Their personal items and clothes are kept in custody.)

896
00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:35.359
- My goodness. - I can't believe we're in prison.

897
00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:37.260
What's happening today?

898
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.260
(What's their first mission?)

899
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.059
- What is this? - There's water.

900
00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:42.059
(There are buckets of water.)

901
00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:43.470
- What's the water for? - What's going on?

902
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.500
Before we officially start,

903
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:49.170
here's your first mission with a chance to increase or reduce...

904
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.339
your sentence.

905
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.770
It's called Wanting to be Forgiven.

906
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.440
(Wanting to be Forgiven)

907
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.809
Confess something you've done wrong to the members.

908
00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:00.250
Based on your sincerity,

909
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.250
others will decrease the hours from 0 to 10 minutes.

910
00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:05.950
Your sentence will be reduced by the total number of minutes.

911
00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:08.520
We're the judges.

912
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.260
The total is 70 minutes maximum.

913
00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.260
(It can be reduced by 0 to 70 minutes.)

914
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.000
- 70 minutes? - It's over an hour.

915
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.670
- 1 hour? - Your sentence could be 23 hours.

916
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.569
Is it a life sentence?

917
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440
It's 1 night 2 days.

918
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.139
- You have to stay here a few days? - What?

919
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.510
- You have to stay here a few days? - What?

920
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.649
Jong Kook will stay here.

921
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:33.079
- What? - Be careful what you say.

922
00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:34.920
Why did you make that comment?

923
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.920
- She's irritating him. - So Min is irritating him.

924
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.990
Let's see.

925
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.819
You will be slapped by water to be forgiven.

926
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.190
If you don't get slapped by water, your sentence will increase.

927
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:47.930
Kwang Soo.

928
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.670
(To whom will he apologize?)

929
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.970
Kwang Soo has a lot to confess.

930
00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.399
After he gets married...

931
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:53.740
(Booing)

932
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.170
Get lost.

933
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.339
- I spit on you. - What's going on?

934
00:33:57.339 --> 00:33:59.039
- I spit on you. - What?

935
00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:00.280
- You're ugly. - He's a petty criminal.

936
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.980
- He's a petty criminal. - Right.

937
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.109
- Your cap looks very cheap. - It's in poop color.

938
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.319
His face looks cheap too.

939
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:09.519
What if he cries?

940
00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:10.720
(Are we being too harsh?)

941
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:11.850
I won't play.

942
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:14.620
I won't.

943
00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:17.430
- He already finished. - Is that it, Kwang Soo?

944
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.290
- Kwang Soo's turn is over. - It's over.

945
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.430
(His turn is over even before he confesses.)

946
00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:26.169
I will confess...

947
00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:27.640
(He wants to ask forgiveness to...)

948
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.870
I will confess to So Min.

949
00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:34.240
- I haven't told this to anyone. - Okay.

950
00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.549
After So Min moved to a new place,

951
00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:40.280
she couldn't install the blinds.

952
00:34:40.549 --> 00:34:43.620
I brought my drill to her house...

953
00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:45.249
and helped her put up the blinds.

954
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:47.319
Why are you asking for forgiveness?

955
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.359
- However, - Did you steal something?

956
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:50.629
So Min.

957
00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:54.330
I cracked the ceiling.

958
00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.499
I cracked the ceiling.

959
00:34:57.769 --> 00:35:00.040
I'm renting my place.

960
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.269
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at installing blinds.

961
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.939
It was harder than I thought.

962
00:35:03.939 --> 00:35:06.310
There are many men like that.

963
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.040
- Just admit that you can't do it. - That's right.

964
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.850
- Suddenly, Kwang Soo said... - Don't pretend to know.

965
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.549
that he felt hot.

966
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.879
- He only had on a sleeveless shirt. - Sleeveless?

967
00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:19.249
(Sleeveless shirt is the extreme end of being pretentious.)

968
00:35:19.249 --> 00:35:20.459
My goodness.

969
00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:22.419
What are you talking about?

970
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.859
- Shouldn't he be penalized? - What are you talking about?

971
00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:27.060
I wasn't wearing a sleeveless shirt. It's a misunderstanding.

972
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.459
- Kwang Soo wears it often. - No way.

973
00:35:29.459 --> 00:35:32.729
- He took off his shirt. - What do you mean?

974
00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:34.700
- He stretched his arms. - No way.

975
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.040
She's lying.

976
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.970
Stretch your arms like this...

977
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.310
while showing your hair on the belly.

978
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.640
(He punches him.)

979
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.910
- Be quiet. - Okay, Kwang Soo.

980
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.810
- Don't talk while older men talk. - Okay.

981
00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:48.450
This is what's funny. He promised to install the blinds.

982
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.620
He went somewhere while the drill was being charged.

983
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.260
- Then he went to Myeongdong. - Why?

984
00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.519
- I don't know why. - Why did you go to Myeongdong?

985
00:35:55.689 --> 00:35:56.729
I went to eat.

986
00:35:56.729 --> 00:35:58.060
(He answers nonchalantly.)

987
00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.560
(Did he go eat by himself?)

988
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.959
I went to eat because I was hungry.

989
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.560
- What about me? - What?

990
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.930
- What about me? - You had no food at home.

991
00:36:07.299 --> 00:36:09.439
What's going on between you two?

992
00:36:09.439 --> 00:36:10.439
(They act like real siblings.)

993
00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:11.709
- That's strange. - He went to eat?

994
00:36:11.709 --> 00:36:12.839
(They act like real siblings.)

995
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:14.140
1, 2, 3.

996
00:36:14.379 --> 00:36:16.209
- 10 minutes. - Really?

997
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.450
Is it 65 minutes?

998
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.549
(The total is 65 minutes.)

999
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.249
If his sentence is two hours,

1000
00:36:20.249 --> 00:36:22.450
- He gets to leave early. - he gets to leave after an hour.

1001
00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:25.450
(I'm sorry, but I don't want to forgive him.)

1002
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.290
- I don't want to forgive him. - Wait.

1003
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.629
That's right, So Min.

1004
00:36:29.629 --> 00:36:30.629
That's a good choice.

1005
00:36:30.729 --> 00:36:32.959
- I won't forgive him. - Good job.

1006
00:36:32.959 --> 00:36:34.100
(His sentence increases by 65 minutes.)

1007
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.899
Let's move to the group cell and start your life in prison.

1008
00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:38.930
- Okay. - Okay.

1009
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.240
(Current sentence minutes)

1010
00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:42.910
(Imprisonment finally starts.)

1011
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.810
- It looks scary below. - It's scary.

1012
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.339
It's scary below. Don't look down.

1013
00:36:46.339 --> 00:36:47.680
I can't walk in the middle.

1014
00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:50.080
- It's not scary. - Come on.

1015
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080
Be a man.

1016
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.080
(They move to the group cell.)

1017
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.780
It's a group cell.

1018
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.419
It's a real cell.

1019
00:36:55.419 --> 00:36:56.689
(This is...)

1020
00:36:56.689 --> 00:36:59.149
(This is a cell for 8 people.)

1021
00:36:59.149 --> 00:37:01.459
It's a real cell that I only heard of.

1022
00:37:01.459 --> 00:37:02.660
"What the cell leader says is the law."

1023
00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.729
(What the cell leader says is the law.)

1024
00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:06.629
- What's this? - It's the restroom.

1025
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.459
This must be the restroom.

1026
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.600
- Is it a real restroom? - It's divided.

1027
00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:13.499
There are toothbrushes for everyone.

1028
00:37:13.499 --> 00:37:14.970
We're really in prison.

1029
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.410
(Basic needs are prepared.)

1030
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.439
- It's cold in here. - Goodness.

1031
00:37:18.439 --> 00:37:20.439
(They can't leave until they serve their sentence.)

1032
00:37:20.439 --> 00:37:21.439
We can't leave.

1033
00:37:21.709 --> 00:37:22.950
- Really? - We're trapped.

1034
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.410
- It feels suffocating already. - It's cold.

1035
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.120
Gosh, is there a way to escape?

1036
00:37:29.149 --> 00:37:32.089
- There's no way to escape at all. - Seriously.

1037
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:34.359
Why are there beans and a millstone?

1038
00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.519
(Beans and a millstone?)

1039
00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.160
(Why are there beans and a millstone in the cell?)

1040
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.729
Why is there a millstone?

1041
00:37:38.729 --> 00:37:39.729
It's a millstone.

1042
00:37:39.859 --> 00:37:44.229
This is the cell where you'll be imprisoned.

1043
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.240
There are two ways to reduce your sentence.

1044
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240
- Okay. - What are they?

1045
00:37:48.339 --> 00:37:51.410
Clear a mission and exchange the sentence with a member...

1046
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.569
whom you suspect has less.

1047
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.040
If you make a block of tofu by using the tools,

1048
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.649
your sentence will be reduced by half.

1049
00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:58.350
(If you make tofu, your sentence will be reduced.)

1050
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.419
- A block of tofu? - We have to make tofu?

1051
00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:01.819
(They can't believe what they hear.)

1052
00:38:01.819 --> 00:38:03.450
- Gosh. - Make a block of tofu?

1053
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.549
- Soft tofu? - Is it possible?

1054
00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:06.260
We're doing everything.

1055
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.660
Did you put them here so that we make tofu?

1056
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.660
- How can we? - You make tofu...

1057
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.399
There are instructions on how to make tofu.

1058
00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:14.830
- You're right. - Gosh.

1059
00:38:15.899 --> 00:38:18.899
(They can learn how to make tofu in prison.)

1060
00:38:18.899 --> 00:38:21.669
What if it takes 12 hours to make tofu?

1061
00:38:21.669 --> 00:38:24.640
- No. - It takes a few hours.

1062
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.680
Use whatever ways to make tofu.

1063
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.810
Then your sentence is reduced by half.

1064
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.180
You may ask someone to bring you tofu as well.

1065
00:38:32.049 --> 00:38:33.249
- Ask someone? - To bring it here?

1066
00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:37.950
We need a phone to call someone to bring tofu.

1067
00:38:38.319 --> 00:38:42.419
It's up to you to find a way.

1068
00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:43.430
It's up to us?

1069
00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:45.959
We can't attach a message to a pigeon or anything.

1070
00:38:45.959 --> 00:38:46.959
Should we yell?

1071
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.200
Can you go out from there?

1072
00:38:51.299 --> 00:38:52.299
Jung Geol!

1073
00:38:52.299 --> 00:38:53.339
(He calls his manager.)

1074
00:38:54.169 --> 00:38:55.240
Jung Geol!

1075
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.609
(Do you hear me?)

1076
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.010
Jung Geol!

1077
00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.609
(If you can hear me, bring me some tofu.)

1078
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.249
Let's start a riot.

1079
00:39:03.249 --> 00:39:04.249
(Let's start a riot.)

1080
00:39:04.249 --> 00:39:05.780
(We'll attack them instead.)

1081
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.519
Start a riot? That's so much like Jong Kook.

1082
00:39:09.749 --> 00:39:11.649
If a member who finished their sentence comes back with tofu,

1083
00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:13.459
that will be accepted.

1084
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.689
- One of us can bring it? - Yes.

1085
00:39:15.689 --> 00:39:16.959
Let's ask one person.

1086
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.459
However, he can only bring one block.

1087
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.129
- Some of us will leave soon. - Right.

1088
00:39:23.129 --> 00:39:24.899
- That's true. - If you have two hours...

1089
00:39:24.899 --> 00:39:28.269
- For me... - Save one person if you leave.

1090
00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.910
The saved member can save someone else.

1091
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.310
- Then we can all leave. - After two hours...

1092
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.180
- We work as a team? - Would that work?

1093
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.339
I don't think so.

1094
00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:36.379
- Someone will betray. - We can help each other.

1095
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.680
And the cell leader has absolute power.

1096
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.979
You must obey the cell leader.

1097
00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:45.120
The cell leader can send the members to the solitary cell.

1098
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.760
(The cell leader can put members in solitary confinement.)

1099
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.260
- That sounds fun. - Do you remember that time?

1100
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.290
He went to the solitary cell, but the cell was the paradise.

1101
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.790
- Right? - That did happen.

1102
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.600
- I was the leader. Do you remember? - Right.

1103
00:39:55.959 --> 00:39:59.330
(He was dragged to the solitary cell for infuriating the cell leader,)

1104
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.200
(but it turned out to be paradise.)

1105
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:05.010
(However, there are 2 solitary cells today.)

1106
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.180
(What kind of secrets are hidden in these solitary cells?)

1107
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.780
Whenever the bell rings, you will vote to select the cell leader,

1108
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.209
- so it may change. - We are going to vote?

1109
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.180
If you vote for me, I'll make...

1110
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.419
- a peaceful environment. - Can you swear to that?

1111
00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:17.490
I won't betray you.

1112
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.890
Ji Hyo never betrays us.

1113
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:20.260
- You know that, right? - Ji Hyo...

1114
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.890
- Then I'm sorry, but... - We should team up.

1115
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.089
- show us a special talent. - Okay.

1116
00:40:25.729 --> 00:40:26.830
Dance for us.

1117
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.729
We have no choice here.

1118
00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:30.729
- Show us your dance. - Okay.

1119
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.169
(Seok Jin dances right away.)

1120
00:40:33.169 --> 00:40:34.269
There's no music.

1121
00:40:34.669 --> 00:40:37.709
(Ambition exudes from his dance.)

1122
00:40:37.709 --> 00:40:39.470
Ji Hyo, you should interrupt him and start dancing.

1123
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.240
(Ji Hyo, the 2nd candidate, starts dancing.)

1124
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.209
(The first cell leader is me, it's me)

1125
00:40:44.209 --> 00:40:45.850
- Ji Hyo, don't forget me. - That's great.

1126
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:48.019
- Okay. - There you go.

1127
00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:49.149
One of them will be the cell leader?

1128
00:40:49.549 --> 00:40:51.220
Is this how we're going to vote for the cell leader?

1129
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.450
- Vote now. - Hey.

1130
00:40:52.549 --> 00:40:53.859
- They must be authoritative. - What else can we do?

1131
00:40:53.859 --> 00:40:55.720
- In that case... - You guys are too mean.

1132
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.990
This isn't how it is in dramas.

1133
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.390
- They are powerful. - Stop talking.

1134
00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.200
- How can cell leaders... - There's no other way.

1135
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.459
- What about recent songs? - Which one knows recent songs?

1136
00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:03.999
Sing the most recent song you know.

1137
00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:05.700
(Sing a recent song among songs you know.)

1138
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.069
(Growl)

1139
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.510
("Growl" by Exo is the title track of their 1st album in 2013.)

1140
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.510
- That's the most recent song? - Growl

1141
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.979
(It sounds like a Korean traditional song.)

1142
00:41:16.479 --> 00:41:18.649
- Growl - Growl

1143
00:41:18.649 --> 00:41:23.319
(It's a different song. It only shares the same title.)

1144
00:41:23.549 --> 00:41:24.919
Growl

1145
00:41:24.919 --> 00:41:26.149
Growl

1146
00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:28.019
- Growl - All right.

1147
00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:30.959
(It's when "Growl" meets Korean traditional music.)

1148
00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.790
Okay. Sing us a more recent song.

1149
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.560
You'll win as long as you don't sing "Chunhyangga".

1150
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.200
- I have a song in mind. - Go ahead.

1151
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.069
(For Ji Hyo, "Hot Issue" has been popular for 8 years.)

1152
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.910
(Which song will she sing this time?)

1153
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.680
(Are you leaving me?)

1154
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.319
- Great. - That's it.

1155
00:41:53.319 --> 00:41:54.850
- Ji Hyo, sing a bit more. - You're almost there.

1156
00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.990
(She sings another line.)

1157
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.990
She got it right.

1158
00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.519
(Babbling)

1159
00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:01.890
(She sings it out of nowhere.)

1160
00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:05.229
What are you doing?

1161
00:42:05.859 --> 00:42:08.129
(After babbling...)

1162
00:42:08.129 --> 00:42:10.799
(You can't fool anyone, Ji Hyo.)

1163
00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:12.269
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo? - What are you doing?

1164
00:42:12.269 --> 00:42:13.540
Is this how you're going to do this?

1165
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.339
(Why does she keep doing this?)

1166
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:18.970
At that time, he came to her.

1167
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.580
All right.

1168
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.510
Should we vote now?

1169
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.680
Which one should I vote for?

1170
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.979
(6 members cast their votes to decide the first cell leader.)

1171
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.580
- I'll announcement it now. - Okay.

1172
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.319
- One of you will be chosen. - Okay.

1173
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.260
(To whom will the honor of becoming the first cell leader go?)

1174
00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.459
The first cell leader is...

1175
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.700
(1st candidate, Seok Jin, 2nd candidate, Ji Hyo)

1176
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.899
Seok Jin.

1177
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.700
(Seok Jin, the ambitious one, is elected as the cell leader.)

1178
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.839
- Mr. Cell Leader. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1179
00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:50.669
- Get away from me. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1180
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.540
- Hey, get away from me. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1181
00:42:52.709 --> 00:42:53.810
I love you.

1182
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.339
- Go away. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1183
00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.780
(Seok Jin is elected after twists and turns.)

1184
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.519
(What kind of environment will he make for the cell?)

1185
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:02.780
(Remaining sentences)

1186
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.450
He became the cell leader just like the other time.

1187
00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:09.359
Hey, whoever voted for me should sit down.

1188
00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:10.729
- Okay. - You should stand over there.

1189
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.299
- Se Chan, go stand over there. - That's right.

1190
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.030
- Jong Kook, you can sit. - Thank you.

1191
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.970
- Kwang Soo, goodness. - The cell leader...

1192
00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:19.799
(The prisoner who's on bad terms with him...)

1193
00:43:19.799 --> 00:43:21.069
- What are you doing? - Move aside.

1194
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:23.640
(The hated prisoner is forced to turn the millstone.)

1195
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.370
- Do your best. - Hey.

1196
00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:27.439
- So Min. - Yes?

1197
00:43:27.439 --> 00:43:28.780
- Sit. - Okay.

1198
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.749
- Stand up. - Okay.

1199
00:43:30.749 --> 00:43:32.709
- Whom should you listen to? - Okay.

1200
00:43:32.709 --> 00:43:33.850
Whom should you listen to?

1201
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.479
- Seok Jin. - Stand up.

1202
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.249
But it looks like Jae Seok is the cell leader.

1203
00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:40.890
(But it looks like Jae Seok is the cell leader.)

1204
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.459
Exactly. You should help Seok Jin out.

1205
00:43:42.459 --> 00:43:44.129
- Jae Seok looks like the leader. - You.

1206
00:43:44.129 --> 00:43:45.760
- Jae Seok, you should go first it. - My goodness.

1207
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.799
- You're getting under my skin. - This is...

1208
00:43:46.799 --> 00:43:48.499
- I wasn't trying to do that. - Who is the cell leader here?

1209
00:43:48.499 --> 00:43:51.530
We let you become the cell leader.

1210
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.069
You "let" me become the leader?

1211
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:54.640
I was the one who helped you get it.

1212
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.839
- Haha. - Yes?

1213
00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:57.870
- You're off now. - Move.

1214
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.510
- Go grind it. - You'd better move.

1215
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.879
- Grind it. - Come and grind this.

1216
00:44:00.879 --> 00:44:02.540
Do you want to join our gang?

1217
00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.879
Yes, I'll serve you for the rest of my life.

1218
00:44:04.879 --> 00:44:06.220
- Go! - Grind it now.

1219
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.350
- Turn the millstone. - How could he change so quickly?

1220
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:08.720
- Is this how you'll play this? - Go work.

1221
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.149
- Are you serious? - I told you to grind it.

1222
00:44:10.149 --> 00:44:11.319
This is a bit...

1223
00:44:11.319 --> 00:44:12.549
- Do as you're told. - Goodness.

1224
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:14.990
(Obey the cell leader.)

1225
00:44:15.959 --> 00:44:18.229
- Wait until the next election. - Hey, kid.

1226
00:44:18.229 --> 00:44:19.959
- Kid. - I got it. "Kid"?

1227
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.700
- Take off your glasses. - By the way...

1228
00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.470
- Hey, hey. - That little jerk.

1229
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:26.569
I wish you'd be more kind to the cellmates,

1230
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:27.839
- What did you say? - sir.

1231
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:30.240
- Send him to the solitary cell. - You should try...

1232
00:44:30.339 --> 00:44:31.839
My goodness.

1233
00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:33.479
- I should do that, right? - Yes, it'd be great.

1234
00:44:33.479 --> 00:44:35.979
(Why don't you put him in the solitary cell now?)

1235
00:44:37.479 --> 00:44:38.680
Hey, I was just...

1236
00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.950
(Solitary cell)

1237
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.120
- Go to the cell. - What?

1238
00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:44.519
- You're scaring me, so go now. - The solitary cell.

1239
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.290
- Seriously? - Go to the cell.

1240
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.830
This is power!

1241
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.629
- See if you can get out of here. - My goodness.

1242
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.229
You know what? I was curious about the cell anyway.

1243
00:44:56.229 --> 00:44:57.729
I was curious about the solitary cell.

1244
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:04.970
(So Jong Kook is dragged to the solitary cell.)

1245
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.310
I can't believe he kicked me out to the solitary cell.

1246
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.109
I made him the cell leader.

1247
00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:14.019
There are two solitary cells.

1248
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.220
Choose the one you like, and enter.

1249
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.720
(He will choose between the 1st and 2nd solitary cell and enter.)

1250
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.859
(The 2 solitary cells give off a creepy vibe.)

1251
00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:23.430
(What secrets lie beyond the doors?)

1252
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.260
I'll choose the Solitary Cell One.

1253
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.899
(Jong Kook chooses the Solitary Cell One.)

1254
00:45:27.899 --> 00:45:29.060
Okay.

1255
00:45:29.084 --> 00:45:33.084
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] SBS E387 Running Man "Along with the New"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1256
00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.109
(The door of the Solitary Cell One opens at last.)

1257
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:39.240
(What is the shocking secret...)

1258
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.709
(Jong Kook will face inside the cell?)

1259
00:45:42.709 --> 00:45:44.950
- Hey, guys. Get some rest. - Yes, sir.

1260
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.080
1, 2, 3.

1261
00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.249
What's this?

1262
00:45:47.249 --> 00:45:49.220
- You already did that much? - Yes.

1263
00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.990
(The bucket is full of bean extract, ground by the millstone.)

1264
00:45:53.959 --> 00:45:55.220
- Hey. - Ji Hyo has a knack for this.

1265
00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:57.290
Ji Hyo is good at cooking too.

1266
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:58.330
(Master of tofu)

1267

(When the rest of them were busy settling their ranks...)

1268
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.700
I think we can make a block of tofu.

1269
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.700
- You think so? - I think we can do it, no?

1270
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.399
(Ji Hyo took over the millstone quietly.)

1271
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:12.740
- I think I am good at this. - Let me help.

1272
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.609
You are good at this.

1273
00:46:14.609 --> 00:46:16.140
We can make tofu with that.

1274
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.749
I think we can make about two blocks of tofu.

1275
00:46:18.749 --> 00:46:20.149
(Can they make tofu and reduce their sentence?)

1276
00:46:20.149 --> 00:46:23.089
- Wait. He's back. - Jong Kook, you're back.

1277
00:46:23.189 --> 00:46:24.249
Look at him.

1278
00:46:24.249 --> 00:46:25.350
- Did you get splashed? - What happened?

1279
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.290
(What goes on in the solitary cell?)

1280
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.089
- What is it? What happened? - He's staring at Seok Jin only.

1281
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.030
He's only looking at Seok Jin.

1282
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.299
What on earth happened?

1283
00:46:33.299 --> 00:46:35.129
(He came back wet. What happened in the solitary cell?)

1284
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.200
I elected you as cell leader.

1285
00:46:37.299 --> 00:46:38.370
Seok Jin.

1286
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.269
- What happens in there? - His pants are completely wet.

1287
00:46:40.399 --> 00:46:42.600
Hey, Jong Kook.

1288
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.069
I only...

1289
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:46.169
sent you there because the cell leader...

1290
00:46:46.169 --> 00:46:48.040
I sent you there because I thought it was a paradise.

1291
00:46:48.379 --> 00:46:50.709
Did you just put your hand on me?

1292
00:46:50.709 --> 00:46:53.350
(He's startled.)

1293
00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:55.780
- Get some rest. - Rest up.

1294
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.049
(The bell rings.)

1295
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.019
- Everyone. - We'll change our cell leader.

1296
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.260
- Okay. - Give it back.

1297
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:04.530
All right. You will elect a new cell leader.

1298
00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.060
Everyone, please help me win the next term.

1299
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.430
The second cell leader has been voted.

1300
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.100
- It's Jong Kook. - Seok Jin.

1301
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.140
(Seok Jin's era is over.)

1302
00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.269
Face the wall.

1303
00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:17.410
(Of course, I should face the wall.)

1304
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.780
- "Face the wall". - That's so downgrading.

1305
00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.709
He sounded so serious. My goodness.

1306
00:47:22.709 --> 00:47:25.879
(I'm all right.)

1307
00:47:25.879 --> 00:47:28.479
(The cell leader's word is law.)

1308
00:47:28.479 --> 00:47:31.019
With the incumbent cell leader, you will complete...

1309
00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.390
- a mission for a Chance Card. - Okay.

1310
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.260
- It's the Voice of the Scene. - "The scene"?

1311
00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:37.359
(A Chance Card is at stake.)

1312
00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:40.359
You will listen to the intro of a randomly chosen film.

1313
00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:42.229
If you guess the film in order, the mission is successful.

1314
00:47:42.729 --> 00:47:44.530
- It's about films? - Whoever guesses...

1315
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.399
the most films will receive the Chance Card.

1316
00:47:46.399 --> 00:47:48.470
(The winning member can acquire a Switch Card.)

1317
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:52.669
(Which 1 of these members will obtain the Switch Card?)

1318
00:47:52.669 --> 00:47:56.040
You can come up with the order to guess the films now.

1319
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.350
It may be advantageous if you go first...

1320
00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.479
or go last.

1321
00:47:59.479 --> 00:48:00.819
This... Tell you what, Jong Kook.

1322
00:48:00.919 --> 00:48:02.450
Listening to the beginning of the film won't be advantageous.

1323
00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.089
So start with Jae Seok,

1324
00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:05.490
- then Kwang Soo. - No, you shouldn't.

1325
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.089
- Make them go first. - You should go sixth.

1326
00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:09.359
- There are eight of us. - Okay.

1327
00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:11.430
- Going fourth is good. It raises... - Okay.

1328
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.430
- your chance. - Seok Jin will go first.

1329
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.100
(Okay. Seok Jin will go 1st.)

1330
00:48:16.399 --> 00:48:17.970
- Jae Seok will go second. - Okay.

1331
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.839
- Kwang Soo, you're third. - What about...

1332
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:21.939
You should go fourth.

1333
00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:23.769
Going fourth isn't that bad.

1334
00:48:23.769 --> 00:48:24.769
(Let me think.)

1335
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:28.339
(What about me?)

1336
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:31.049
I'll go fourth.

1337
00:48:31.149 --> 00:48:32.979
So Min wasn't chosen.

1338
00:48:33.049 --> 00:48:34.519
- She won't go in the beginning. - The fifth place...

1339
00:48:34.519 --> 00:48:36.620
The member in fifth place is likely to guess the correct answer.

1340
00:48:36.689 --> 00:48:38.019
- Haha. - Thank you, Jong Kook.

1341
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:40.419
- That's not fair. - It's not fair at all.

1342
00:48:40.419 --> 00:48:41.790
You favor Haha the most.

1343
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:43.030
I'll go 5th, and he'll go 6th.

1344
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.390
After Se Chan,

1345
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.629
Ji Hyo will go.

1346
00:48:46.629 --> 00:48:47.930
Isn't it nice?

1347
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.200
So Min is last.

1348
00:48:49.569 --> 00:48:50.799
So Min...

1349
00:48:50.799 --> 00:48:52.899
You won't even give her a chance.

1350
00:48:52.899 --> 00:48:54.169
- Right. - It will be the hardest for her.

1351
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.069
All right. I'll play the film for the first quiz.

1352
00:48:57.339 --> 00:49:00.080
The traffic jam during the morning rush hour has completely subsided.

1353
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.810
(It's from the first film.)

1354
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:05.109
This is bad.

1355
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:06.350
I think I know which film it is.

1356
00:49:07.479 --> 00:49:08.749
This is...

1357
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.549
I bet...

1358
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:12.390
- it's a disaster film. - Five.

1359
00:49:13.189 --> 00:49:14.790
It's a disaster film or a film with a monster.

1360
00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.430
I know the answer.

1361
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.089
"The Host".

1362
00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:21.499
- "The Host". - "The Host".

1363
00:49:21.499 --> 00:49:22.700
"The Host" directed by Bong Joon Ho.

1364
00:49:23.499 --> 00:49:24.629
(That's incorrect.)

1365
00:49:24.629 --> 00:49:26.069
(That was close.)

1366
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:27.470
That wasn't even close.

1367
00:49:27.669 --> 00:49:28.839
I'll give you the next line.

1368
00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:31.040
- Play the film. - It won't be my turn anytime soon.

1369
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:33.479
The traffic is smooth on Dongbu and Seobu Expressway.

1370
00:49:33.939 --> 00:49:35.510
- It's a traffic report. - Hold on.

1371
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:37.950
Traffic is moderate on Dongbu Expressway and Seobu Expressway.

1372
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.549
Is this traffic radio?

1373
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:42.019
- Hold on. - Is this supposed to be a movie?

1374
00:49:42.019 --> 00:49:44.890
- This is... - I might have a chance.

1375
00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:49.560
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1376
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:53.999
Okay. Whose turn is it now?

1377
00:49:53.999 --> 00:49:55.030
It's my turn.

1378
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.430
Play the next line.

1379
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.269
On Gangbyeon Expressway and Olympic Expressway,

1380
00:49:59.269 --> 00:50:01.069
traffic looks good all the way...

1381
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:03.010
from Cheonho Bridge to Banghwa Bridge.

1382
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.609
- That was short. - Isn't this just traffic radio?

1383
00:50:06.609 --> 00:50:07.709
(What is this movie?)

1384
00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:09.310
- "The Tunnel". - I think that's right.

1385
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.680
("The Tunnel")

1386
00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:15.120
(Is it correct?)

1387
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:16.620
I was thinking of that one too.

1388
00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.049
- It's wrong? - It's wrong?

1389
00:50:18.049 --> 00:50:19.760
(Kwang Soo is wrong.)

1390
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.459
I thought it was correct.

1391
00:50:21.459 --> 00:50:23.459
- Really? - I was thinking of that one too.

1392
00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:25.189
- Ha Jung Woo is in it. - Ha Jung Woo is in it.

1393
00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:26.930
I thought it was "The Tunnel".

1394
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.859
Here goes the next line.

1395
00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:31.569
There's another piece of news.

1396
00:50:31.569 --> 00:50:33.470
(I know it.)

1397
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.970
Another piece of news?

1398
00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.870
I don't remember the title.

1399
00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:40.510
Ha Jung Woo is in it.

1400
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.350
In the radio booth...

1401
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:45.979
I watched that movie.

1402
00:50:45.979 --> 00:50:48.319
- 5, 4, - Hold on.

1403
00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:50.390
- 3, 2... - That's too fast.

1404
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.019
(Surprised)

1405
00:50:52.019 --> 00:50:53.660
Don't count down so fast.

1406
00:50:53.819 --> 00:50:56.760
- 100, 99, - Hold on.

1407
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.160
- 98, 97... - 98, 97...

1408
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.729
It's supposed to be two syllables...

1409
00:51:00.729 --> 00:51:01.830
No.

1410
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:04.930
- No. - "The Terror Live".

1411
00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:06.740
("The Terror Live")

1412
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.999
"The Terror Live".

1413
00:51:08.669 --> 00:51:09.839
(Correct)

1414
00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:11.209
I knew it too.

1415
00:51:11.209 --> 00:51:13.080
- I knew it too. - I can't believe I remembered it.

1416
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.640
I knew it too.

1417
00:51:16.479 --> 00:51:21.479
(The movie starts with a traffic announcement.)

1418
00:51:21.479 --> 00:51:27.089
(It's a thriller movie starring Ha Jung Woo.)

1419
00:51:27.089 --> 00:51:29.729
(Congratulations, Jong Kook.)

1420
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:33.160
- Do you remember it now? - Yes.

1421
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.299
- "The Terror Live". - Now, I remember it.

1422
00:51:35.299 --> 00:51:36.999
- Here we go. - I'll get it right this time.

1423
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:39.030
- Start. - Ghosts...

1424
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.069
(The second question)

1425
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:41.999
I know it.

1426
00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:43.069
(Roaring)

1427
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:46.439
No resort in bird sanctuary!

1428
00:51:46.439 --> 00:51:47.640
I know this one.

1429
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.379
(No resort in bird sanctuary!)

1430
00:51:49.379 --> 00:51:52.310
- I know this one. - What is this?

1431
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.620
- Gosh. - I know it.

1432
00:51:54.149 --> 00:51:56.120
You have to know this.

1433
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.149
- Haha. - It's obvious.

1434
00:51:58.149 --> 00:51:59.589
- What? - Yes.

1435
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.560
- "1987: When the Day Comes". - Gosh.

1436
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.359
- What are you talking about? - "1987: When the Day Comes"?

1437
00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:05.930
It's still showing at cinemas.

1438
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.129
There's no way they'd play it here.

1439
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:10.069
- Kwang Soo. - The next line.

1440
00:52:10.269 --> 00:52:12.330
- Play it. - I want to get it right.

1441
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:13.540
The title is...

1442
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.569
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1443
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:16.510
- Withdraw! - Withdraw!

1444
00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:20.680
They repeated the same word.

1445
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.910
If I tell you the answer,

1446
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.649
- can you move me up? - They repeated the same word.

1447
00:52:27.649 --> 00:52:29.479
- Okay. - I'm serious.

1448
00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:33.419
Can you discuss with others?

1449
00:52:33.419 --> 00:52:35.319
5, 4, 3,

1450
00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.089
- 2, 1. - 2, 1.

1451
00:52:37.089 --> 00:52:38.290
"A Violent Prosecutor".

1452
00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:44.100
("A Violent Prosecutor")

1453
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:45.600
It's correct.

1454
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.069
I was right.

1455
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.540
I was right. Move me up two spots.

1456
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.609
- Move me up. - Okay.

1457
00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:52.810
- It's with Gang Dong Won. - Okay.

1458
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.780
I knew it was the one with Gang Dong Won.

1459
00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:03.249
(The movie starts with a protest to protect a bird sanctuary.)

1460
00:53:03.249 --> 00:53:08.859
(So Min was very impressed by Gang Dong Won's swindler role.)

1461
00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.290
- Can you move me up? - Which place do you want?

1462
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:13.600
Me?

1463
00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.370
The one before you.

1464
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:17.569
The one before me? Okay.

1465
00:53:17.669 --> 00:53:19.499
Wait. Is that tofu?

1466
00:53:19.499 --> 00:53:21.499
- Tofu arrived. - What?

1467
00:53:21.499 --> 00:53:23.669
(Tofu arrived?)

1468
00:53:23.669 --> 00:53:26.680
(Tofu arrived.)

1469
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.939
Tofu arrived.

1470
00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:29.810
How did it get here?

1471
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:33.049
- Tofu? How did it get here? - How did it get here?

1472
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:35.350
(How did the tofu get here?)

1473
00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:38.189
It's for Jong Kook.

1474
00:53:38.189 --> 00:53:39.390
How did it get here?

1475
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.459
- It's for Jong Kook. - How did it get here?

1476
00:53:42.459 --> 00:53:44.359
What happened?

1477
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.060
- Okay. - How did he do it?

1478
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.629
- I'm so relieved. - You should eat it.

1479
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:52.200
Did you make it in the solitary cell?

1480
00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:53.870
He must have done something.

1481
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.839
- He must've carried out a mission. - He must have made it there.

1482
00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:58.240
Send me to the solitary cell.

1483
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.310
(What happens in the solitary cell?)

1484
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.410
There must be something...

1485
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.749
in the solitary cell.

1486
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:08.249
(What's the secret of the solitary cells?)

1487
00:54:08.249 --> 00:54:09.319
Number eight.

1488
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:12.189
Send me to the solitary cell now.

1489
00:54:12.189 --> 00:54:13.720
Can I send someone to the solitary cell?

1490
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.959
- Yes. - Send me now.

1491
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.189
Guys, there's more than one solitary cell.

1492
00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.260
You should know that.

1493
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.100
- That's up to you. - Right.

1494
00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.760
- The solitary cell... - You wanted to go.

1495
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.129
See you.

1496
00:54:24.129 --> 00:54:25.970
Thank you. I'll see you in a while.

1497
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:27.899
- See you. - Go to the solitary cell.

1498
00:54:27.899 --> 00:54:30.669
(Haha is looking forward to winning tofu.)

1499
00:54:30.669 --> 00:54:31.910
Hello.

1500
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.879
I'm a model prisoner.

1501
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:36.810
Please choose between...

1502
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.180
the two solitary cells.

1503
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.180
(Haha has to choose.)

1504
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.450
(Let me see.)

1505
00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.819
I choose number two.

1506
00:54:44.819 --> 00:54:46.390
- Okay. Please go in. - Okay.

1507
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.890
(Haha chooses number 2 unlike Jong Kook.)

1508
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:54.129
(What's in solitary cell number 2?)

1509
00:54:54.129 --> 00:54:55.229
What's that?

1510
00:54:57.299 --> 00:54:59.530
What's that? Wait.

1511
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.970
(Pots?)

1512
00:55:03.209 --> 00:55:05.310
(Let me sit down.)

1513
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:08.209
You're in the solitary cell with pots.

1514
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:12.310
You'll be splashed with water.

1515
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.519
That's it?

1516
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.450
That's it?

1517
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.120
(Really?)

1518
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:21.089
What's going on?

1519
00:55:21.089 --> 00:55:24.959
Please splash the water. 1, 2, 3.

1520
00:55:25.129 --> 00:55:27.859
(Splash)

1521
00:55:27.859 --> 00:55:30.470
(Soaked)

1522
00:55:30.569 --> 00:55:34.499
(Can I get tofu now?)

1523
00:55:34.499 --> 00:55:35.999
You can go back now.

1524
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:41.709
(That's it?)

1525
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.379
(All this cell has are pots.)

1526
00:55:43.379 --> 00:55:44.479
Gosh.

1527
00:55:45.379 --> 00:55:47.850
What is this? Jong Kook took a lot longer.

1528
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.720
(What was in the solitary cell Jong Kook went to?)

1529
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.450
- I choose number one. - Okay.

1530
00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:58.390
(What was in solitary cell number 1?)

1531
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:04.129
(Spend some time alone in the cozy solitary cell.)

1532
00:56:04.229 --> 00:56:05.930
(You can take a break from the cold and hunger here.)

1533
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:08.370
I thought I'd be penalized.

1534
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.640
(This is nice.)

1535
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:13.979
There's a phone.

1536
00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:15.640
(There's a cell phone?)

1537
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.680
Can I use it?

1538
00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:20.419
(He can talk to someone outside.)

1539
00:56:20.419 --> 00:56:22.249
- Hello. - Deok Jin.

1540
00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:24.519
- This is Jong Kook. - Hi.

1541
00:56:24.519 --> 00:56:27.220
Can you get me some tofu?

1542
00:56:28.019 --> 00:56:29.589
Excuse me.

1543
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:30.930
- Do you have tofu? - Yes.

1544
00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:33.930
- Please give this to Jong Kook. - Okay.

1545
00:56:33.999 --> 00:56:36.060
- Tell him he can take his time. - Okay.

1546
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.399
(After secretly asking for tofu...)

1547
00:56:39.399 --> 00:56:40.569
Is there some water?

1548
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.140
Please give me some water.

1549
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:47.109
(He wets his clothes to deceive others.)

1550
00:56:47.209 --> 00:56:50.280
(This way, they won't suspect anything.)

1551
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.749
(That's how he had tofu delivered.)

1552
00:56:54.879 --> 00:56:56.890
Is this all?

1553
00:56:57.649 --> 00:56:58.819
Wait.

1554
00:56:58.819 --> 00:56:59.959
(I don't believe it.)

1555
00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:01.019
Hold on.

1556
00:57:01.319 --> 00:57:03.060
Let me go to cell number one.

1557
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.390
Please let me go to a solitary cell.

1558
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:06.700
Let me go.

1559
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.760
Let me go to a solitary cell!

1560
00:57:09.629 --> 00:57:10.999
Please!

1561
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.269
(Haha only got penalized.)

1562
00:57:13.269 --> 00:57:14.799
- Haha is back. - Ji Hyo.

1563
00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:17.069
Please send me one more time.

1564
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:19.010
What did you do?

1565
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:20.339
Please send me one more time.

1566
00:57:20.339 --> 00:57:21.609
Right now.

1567
00:57:21.609 --> 00:57:22.709
- No. - No?

1568
00:57:22.709 --> 00:57:25.010
- What happened? - Please send me one more time.

1569
00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:26.780
Hit me once.

1570
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.319
(Kicking)

1571
00:57:29.319 --> 00:57:30.350
Go to the solitary cell.

1572
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:32.549
Go to the solitary cell.

1573
00:57:32.959 --> 00:57:34.260
Haha will go to...

1574
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.120
- the solitary cell. - What's going on?

1575
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.890
- What's there? - Ji Hyo.

1576
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:38.990
(I'll choose cell number 1 this time.)

1577
00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:40.459
Cell number one.

1578
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.370
- Between the 2 cells... - I choose number 1.

1579
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:47.169
(He chooses number 1 without hesitation.)

1580
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:51.709
(Angry)

1581
00:57:51.709 --> 00:57:53.580
Hey!

1582
00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.379
(Why are the pots here again?)

1583
00:57:56.749 --> 00:57:59.720
(The cells switch all the time.)

1584
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:03.450
(Gosh, I'm so unlucky.)

1585
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.189
(Splash)

1586
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:13.399
(He's splashed for the 2nd time.)

1587
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:16.999
I'll be right back.

1588
00:58:16.999 --> 00:58:18.299
(Angry)

1589
00:58:18.299 --> 00:58:22.040
(Haha only got splashed with water.)

1590
00:58:22.339 --> 00:58:25.169
Let's continue with the quiz.

1591
00:58:25.169 --> 00:58:26.169
- Okay. - Okay.

1592
00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.209
Before that,

1593
00:58:27.439 --> 00:58:31.080
- Se Chan will be released. - Okay!

1594
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.979
- Why? - Okay!

1595
00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.379
- Se Chan will be released. - Yes!

1596
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.560
(Every member picked a sentence card.)

1597
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.060
(Se Chan's sentence was only 3 hours.)

1598
00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.390
(It's not bad.)

1599
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:48.830
(His sentence even got reduced by 70 minutes.)

1600
00:58:50.629 --> 00:58:53.299
(Se Chan is released...)

1601
00:58:53.299 --> 00:58:54.669
(after serving his sentence.)

1602
00:58:54.669 --> 00:58:56.669
- Yes! - Has it been two hours?

1603
00:58:56.669 --> 00:58:58.609
- Please get me tofu. - Was his sentence two hours?

1604
00:58:58.609 --> 00:59:00.479
Please get me tofu.

1605
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:03.850
- Please. - Everyone, worship me!

1606
00:59:04.209 --> 00:59:05.209
Se Chan.

1607
00:59:05.209 --> 00:59:06.580
- Everyone, - I won't ask for more.

1608
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.649
- serve me. - Please.

1609
00:59:07.649 --> 00:59:09.479
Please change.

1610
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.819
- Is he really getting out? - You can go.

1611
00:59:10.819 --> 00:59:11.950
Can I really go?

1612
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:13.120
Can I go home?

1613
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.490
Yes!

1614
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:15.859
I could come back with tofu, right?

1615
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.530
I should go back to tofu-making.

1616
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:19.799
Worship Se Chan

1617
00:59:19.899 --> 00:59:21.459
- Please. - I'll remember you.

1618
00:59:21.459 --> 00:59:22.830
- Guys. - Se Chan.

1619
00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.499
- So Min, you've been so quiet. - Se Chan!

1620
00:59:25.499 --> 00:59:27.769
- You... - Have a good life.

1621
00:59:27.769 --> 00:59:30.269
Live for yourself. Don't ever come back here.

1622
00:59:30.269 --> 00:59:32.709
What are you talking about?

1623
00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.439
I don't believe you.

1624
00:59:35.609 --> 00:59:38.010
Take care of yourself first. Goodness.

1625
00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:39.879
Don't come back to this dirty place.

1626
00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.720
Go live a happy life, punk.

1627
00:59:43.319 --> 00:59:50.129
(He leaves prison without lingering feelings.)

1628
00:59:51.629 --> 00:59:55.530
(The mission to win Chance Cards starts.)

1629
00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:57.799
Who will win the card?

1630
00:59:57.999 --> 01:00:00.100
Play the movie.

1631
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.100
(Third movie plays.)

1632
01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:05.370
(A door opens.)

1633
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:11.510
(Sound of heels clacking on the floor)

1634
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:15.379
(The sound continues. Gosh, it's nice to meet you, ma'am.)

1635
01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.819
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

1636
01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.790
(Jong Kook is 1st, Ji Hyo is 2nd, and Jae Seok is 3rd.)

1637
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:24.930
(I think I recognize the movie.)

1638
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.629
(If Jong Kook is wrong, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok get a chance.)

1639
01:00:27.629 --> 01:00:28.629
Goodness.

1640
01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:32.100
(If Jong Kook is wrong, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok get a chance.)

1641
01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.140
What's your answer?

1642
01:00:33.399 --> 01:00:34.470
"The Thieves"?

1643
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:36.100
(He makes a guess.)

1644
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.010
(If he's correct, Jong Kook wins.)

1645
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:41.010
"The Thieves".

1646
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:43.350
- That's right. - Is that correct?

1647
01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.910
("The Thieves" is correct.)

1648
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:47.979
That's what I thought at first. I knew it.

1649
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.919
(It's a scene from "The Thieves"...)

1650
01:00:53.919 --> 01:00:58.729
(where Jun Ji Hyun and Shin Ha Kyun meet.)

1651
01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.359
Did Jong Kook win?

1652
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.870
I have to switch with someone.

1653
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.339
One of you will be released very soon.

1654
01:01:08.339 --> 01:01:09.370
Really?

1655
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:16.510
(Jong Kook's life will change if he switches with this member.)

1656
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.149
- Is it three hours? - This is your chance.

1657
01:01:18.149 --> 01:01:19.180
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

1658
01:01:19.249 --> 01:01:21.319
- It's worth it to try. - You can switch with me.

1659
01:01:21.519 --> 01:01:26.919
By the way, why are you so quiet, So Min?

1660
01:01:26.919 --> 01:01:28.560
- Wait a minute. - What?

1661
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.629
- Listen. - Can we leave?

1662
01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:33.399
- So Min? - She's so quiet.

1663
01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:35.260
- So Min is... - Isn't she so calm?

1664
01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.229
- She seems disconnected from us. - Right.

1665
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.330
- She's so quiet. - She's not saying much at all.

1666
01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:43.410
She sympathizes with you because she's being released soon.

1667
01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.910
So Min.

1668
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.510
(He chooses So Min.)

1669
01:01:47.609 --> 01:01:49.780
- Jong Kook switched... - No way.

1670
01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.749
- No. - his sentence with So Min.

1671
01:01:52.149 --> 01:01:53.649
(Jong Kook and So Min are enemies.)

1672
01:01:53.649 --> 01:01:54.780
(They switch their sentences.)

1673
01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.350
- All right. - I'm curious.

1674
01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.720
The two of you will check your sentences after switching.

1675
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.120
We'll turn our backs.

1676
01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.160
(What was So Min's sentence?)

1677
01:02:03.129 --> 01:02:04.589
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

1678
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.030
What's wrong?

1679
01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.399
(Did you read my sentence?)

1680
01:02:10.399 --> 01:02:11.830
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1681
01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:13.399
My goodness.

1682
01:02:13.399 --> 01:02:14.999
(Her sentence is 10 hours.)

1683
01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:18.109
- I can make 20 blocks of tofu. - My sentence is...

1684
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:19.240
Let's see.

1685
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.257
(What was Jong Kook's sentence?)

1686
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.939
(What was Jong Kook's sentence?)

1687
01:02:26.939 --> 01:02:31.508
(It was 10 minutes.)

1688
01:02:33.778 --> 01:02:37.348
(So Min gets 2 hours of sentence.)

1689
01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.089
She started making tofu.

1690
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:42.628
- Why are you making tofu? - Why?

1691
01:02:43.228 --> 01:02:44.359
Why is she making tofu?

1692
01:02:44.359 --> 01:02:46.369
- She's suddenly making tofu. - She wouldn't make tofu.

1693
01:02:46.369 --> 01:02:48.268
I got goosebumps.

1694
01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:49.429
What happened?

1695
01:02:50.168 --> 01:02:52.339
- What happened? - What is it?

1696
01:02:52.339 --> 01:02:53.369
What happened?

1697
01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:56.708
My goodness.

1698
01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.609
- What's going on? - What happened?

1699
01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:01.009
What happened? Why are you about to cry?

1700
01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:03.018
What happened? Is it good or bad?

1701
01:03:03.018 --> 01:03:04.918
- What happened? - Ji Hyo.

1702
01:03:05.478 --> 01:03:07.449
- Please send me back once more. - I want...

1703
01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:09.089
- Please. - I want to go to the solitary cell.

1704
01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:11.119
- Do it before I hit you. - Are you the cell leader?

1705
01:03:11.219 --> 01:03:12.489
Please send me once more.

1706
01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.058
- That's a threat. - It's a threat.

1707
01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:15.089
- That's a threat. - Yes.

1708
01:03:15.089 --> 01:03:16.958
- Don't send him. - Please just once.

1709
01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:19.098
- Don't send him. - It's the last time.

1710
01:03:19.098 --> 01:03:21.228
I won't ask for it anymore.

1711
01:03:21.228 --> 01:03:22.268
(A whistle blows.)

1712
01:03:22.268 --> 01:03:23.538
- What? - Jong Kook is released.

1713
01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:24.898
(Jong Kook is released.)

1714
01:03:24.898 --> 01:03:25.969
(Laughing)

1715
01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.268
- Really? - His sentence was three hours.

1716
01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:29.639
It was him.

1717
01:03:30.438 --> 01:03:32.009
- That's why... - Is this possible?

1718
01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:34.378
- you made tofu, didn't you? - This is real victory.

1719
01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:38.248
(Thanks to So Min, he's the 2nd to be released.)

1720
01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:39.418
(Thanks to you, I can smell the fresh air.)

1721
01:03:39.418 --> 01:03:41.089
- Goodbye, So Min. - Jong Kook can hit Haha.

1722
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:42.958
- Be happy, Jong Kook. - I will.

1723
01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:45.589
Don't we get another chance?

1724
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.359
Is the four-hour sentence next?

1725
01:03:48.889 --> 01:03:51.228
There's one more mission left.

1726
01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.228
- One more. - Is that so?

1727
01:03:52.699 --> 01:03:54.069
Until...

1728
01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:57.268
6pm...

1729
01:03:57.268 --> 01:03:58.498
(The one who has the most by 6pm must serve their sentence.)

1730
01:03:58.498 --> 01:03:59.739
Unless something changes,

1731
01:03:59.739 --> 01:04:02.639
the person who has the longest sentence by 6pm...

1732
01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:06.748
will serve the entire sentence. Then they'll get a self-bath.

1733
01:04:06.748 --> 01:04:08.348
That will be So Min.

1734
01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:09.679
- Don't leave me. - It's So Min.

1735
01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.819
You have a chance to switch.

1736
01:04:10.819 --> 01:04:12.378
We have a chance, right?

1737
01:04:12.378 --> 01:04:14.049
(Who will win the last Switch Card?)

1738
01:04:14.049 --> 01:04:15.688
- I still have a chance. - If someone brings you tofu...

1739
01:04:15.688 --> 01:04:17.558
Why do you keep making tofu?

1740
01:04:17.989 --> 01:04:21.589
From the back, she looks like a tofu expert.

1741
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:22.889
(She's almost like a tofu expert.)

1742
01:04:22.889 --> 01:04:26.469
She has bits of beans on her. Doesn't she?

1743
01:04:26.469 --> 01:04:27.628
(She has a 10-hour sentence.)

1744
01:04:29.429 --> 01:04:30.639
Is it colder outside?

1745
01:04:30.768 --> 01:04:31.869
It's chilly.

1746
01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.509
It's cold.

1747
01:04:34.509 --> 01:04:37.109
(They get to exercise outside.)

1748
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:39.208
- It's very cold. - It's been a long time.

1749
01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.308
(Kwang Soo is moved.)

1750
01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:41.679
I haven't been out in so long.

1751
01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:43.219
There's sunlight.

1752
01:04:43.219 --> 01:04:45.418
(They almost forgot about the warm sunlight.)

1753
01:04:45.719 --> 01:04:47.319
It's good to be outside.

1754
01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:49.049
He's trying to escape.

1755
01:04:49.049 --> 01:04:50.589
(He runs fast.)

1756
01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:51.889
You could get shot.

1757
01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:55.188
(How dare he try to escape?)

1758
01:04:55.989 --> 01:04:57.058
(I was only jogging.)

1759
01:04:57.058 --> 01:04:58.558
This is great.

1760
01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:00.469
(So Min approaches the producer.)

1761
01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:02.598
- Wait. - What is it?

1762
01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:05.299
Kwang Soo was about to steal it. I'll keep it here for now.

1763
01:05:05.299 --> 01:05:06.909
(It's her precious tofu.)

1764
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:10.078
(While the others were playing,)

1765
01:05:10.509 --> 01:05:12.239
(she turned the millstone.)

1766
01:05:12.239 --> 01:05:13.648
(She kept turning it...)

1767
01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:14.978
(and worked hard.)

1768
01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:17.619
(So Min completed a block of tofu.)

1769
01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.378
(Please protect my tofu.)

1770
01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:22.288
Among us, who has the least...

1771
01:05:22.288 --> 01:05:23.458
amount of sentence?

1772
01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:25.989
- I can't tell you. - Really?

1773
01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.728
I bet it's Kwang Soo.

1774
01:05:28.089 --> 01:05:29.288
- It's Kwang Soo. - What?

1775
01:05:29.288 --> 01:05:31.598
- I bet it's Kwang Soo. - It's either Kwang Soo or Seok Jin.

1776
01:05:32.498 --> 01:05:33.498
I think it's you.

1777
01:05:33.498 --> 01:05:34.598
(I doubt it.)

1778
01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.998
Will Jong Kook bring some tofu?

1779
01:05:37.639 --> 01:05:39.808
- I think he left with Se Chan. - Why doesn't he?

1780
01:05:39.808 --> 01:05:40.808
He's not bringing back tofu.

1781
01:05:40.808 --> 01:05:42.639
(Who will be released next?)

1782
01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:46.179
Here's the mission for the last Chance Card.

1783
01:05:46.648 --> 01:05:50.319
- It's Red Light, Green Light. - What is it?

1784
01:05:50.319 --> 01:05:52.148
(Red Light, Green Light)

1785
01:05:52.779 --> 01:05:54.518
The one who will be It...

1786
01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.458
is our new producer who was a drill instructor in the military.

1787
01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:58.458
(He's the new producer.)

1788
01:05:58.458 --> 01:05:59.628
- A drill instructor? - Really?

1789
01:05:59.628 --> 01:06:00.889
(It's nice to meet you.)

1790
01:06:00.889 --> 01:06:02.558
- He used to be a drill instructor. - Hello.

1791
01:06:02.889 --> 01:06:05.728
He'll give you an order before saying "Red Light, Green Light".

1792
01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:09.168
If he gives an order of two people looking at each other,

1793
01:06:09.168 --> 01:06:11.398
you must look at each other to not be eliminated.

1794
01:06:12.199 --> 01:06:15.009
Either tap him and come back to the safety line,

1795
01:06:15.009 --> 01:06:17.208
or be the last person to survive.

1796
01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:19.708
- That's how you win. - I'll win.

1797
01:06:20.049 --> 01:06:22.549
You must choose a partner who won't betray.

1798
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:23.878
- Right. - I'll play with Ji Hyo.

1799
01:06:23.878 --> 01:06:26.078
- You know that I won't betray. - I want to play with her too.

1800
01:06:26.348 --> 01:06:27.748
You know that I won't betray.

1801
01:06:27.889 --> 01:06:29.449
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo, let's play.

1802
01:06:29.449 --> 01:06:31.589
Let's cooperate until the end.

1803
01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:34.489
- I don't want to play with him. - I have to survive.

1804
01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:36.598
- Me neither. - Do you promise me?

1805
01:06:36.598 --> 01:06:37.598
I'll support you.

1806
01:06:37.598 --> 01:06:39.799
Here is some tofu

1807
01:06:39.799 --> 01:06:41.369
(It's a surprise.)

1808
01:06:41.369 --> 01:06:43.069
- Se Chan! - Hey.

1809
01:06:43.469 --> 01:06:47.339
(Have you been waiting? I brought tofu to save you.)

1810
01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:49.409
(It's tofu. No, it's Se Chan.)

1811
01:06:49.409 --> 01:06:50.478
Se Chan!

1812
01:06:50.478 --> 01:06:51.609
(It's tofu. No, it's Se Chan.)

1813
01:06:51.609 --> 01:06:55.009
Here is some fresh tofu

1814
01:06:55.009 --> 01:06:58.848
(Fresh tofu will reduce their sentence by half.)

1815
01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.049
(That's mine.)

1816
01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:02.589
- Se Chan. - Se Chan.

1817
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:04.859
(So Min loses her slippers.)

1818
01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.728
(Give that to me, Se Chan.)

1819
01:07:08.728 --> 01:07:10.799
- Here's some tofu. - Se Chan.

1820
01:07:10.898 --> 01:07:11.998
- Hey. - Se Chan.

1821
01:07:11.998 --> 01:07:13.598
- Se Chan. - Here's some tofu.

1822
01:07:13.598 --> 01:07:16.869
(Se Chan plays hard to get with his tofu.)

1823
01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:18.268
- Pass it to me. - Se Chan.

1824
01:07:18.299 --> 01:07:19.438
- Come here. - It's tofu.

1825
01:07:19.438 --> 01:07:20.469
(Follow me if you want it.)

1826
01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.768
- Here's some tofu. - Se Chan, please.

1827
01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.438
Give me some tofu.

1828
01:07:24.009 --> 01:07:27.978
Se Chan, look at me. I was too excited to see you.

1829
01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:29.308
I was excited to see you.

1830
01:07:29.308 --> 01:07:30.478
(Her feet are covered with mud.)

1831
01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:33.119
It's not because you're excited to see me.

1832
01:07:33.348 --> 01:07:35.518
- Your shoes are too big. - Right.

1833
01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:36.888
I'm desperate.

1834
01:07:36.888 --> 01:07:37.989
(I'm desperate for tofu.)

1835
01:07:37.989 --> 01:07:38.989
I'm desperate.

1836
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.728
- Prisoners. - Yes, sir.

1837
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:43.098
I can't hear you. Prisoners!

1838
01:07:43.098 --> 01:07:44.129
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1839
01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:46.499
- That's not enough. Sit down. - Yes, sir!

1840
01:07:46.728 --> 01:07:48.798
- Please, sir. - Se Chan.

1841
01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:51.098
One of us will get to leave soon.

1842
01:07:51.098 --> 01:07:52.098
Give it to me.

1843
01:07:52.098 --> 01:07:55.638
(Give the tofu to me.)

1844
01:07:56.539 --> 01:08:01.209
(I want to go out into the world with that tofu.)

1845
01:08:01.409 --> 01:08:02.478
Move back.

1846
01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:05.348
(He becomes authoritative.)

1847
01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:08.419
You're funny. That was hilarious.

1848
01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:10.419
Se Chan, it was a funny comment.

1849
01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.718
- Unbelievable. - I'm serious.

1850
01:08:11.718 --> 01:08:13.688
Everyone has their reasons.

1851
01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:16.359
- How about this? - What?

1852
01:08:16.598 --> 01:08:19.699
Hide the tofu somewhere on the second floor.

1853
01:08:19.699 --> 01:08:21.829
- The first to find it gets it. - That's a good idea.

1854
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:23.398
- That's not a bad idea. - Right?

1855
01:08:23.968 --> 01:08:26.638
Please fix Kwang Soo's microphone.

1856
01:08:26.638 --> 01:08:29.268
(Kwang Soo's microphone falls out.)

1857
01:08:29.268 --> 01:08:32.209
- It fell off. - Let's leave him out.

1858
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:33.348
- What? - Leave him out.

1859
01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.449
What does it have to do with my microphone falling off?

1860
01:08:36.449 --> 01:08:38.978
(The battery in the microphone is being changed.)

1861
01:08:38.978 --> 01:08:40.518
- How... - Get lost.

1862
01:08:40.518 --> 01:08:41.588
Why would I?

1863
01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.489
- You didn't take care of yourself. - He didn't take care of himself.

1864
01:08:44.489 --> 01:08:45.659
Haha is right.

1865
01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:47.228
- What do you mean? - You didn't take care of yourself.

1866
01:08:47.228 --> 01:08:48.859
- Line up after Jae Seok. - Okay.

1867
01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.598
Jae Seok, Haha,

1868
01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:52.798
- and Ji Hyo. - He didn't take care of himself.

1869
01:08:54.199 --> 01:08:55.369
Am I excluded?

1870
01:08:56.268 --> 01:08:57.768
(Pushing)

1871
01:08:58.669 --> 01:09:02.239
(He takes his anger out on a staff member.)

1872
01:09:02.239 --> 01:09:06.449
(Things likes this only happen to Kwang Soo.)

1873
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:07.879
Am I excluded?

1874
01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:09.249
(Gosh)

1875
01:09:09.848 --> 01:09:12.018
I'll hide it on the second floor.

1876
01:09:12.018 --> 01:09:14.289
- Finders keepers. - Okay.

1877
01:09:14.289 --> 01:09:16.518
Kwang Soo will be excluded. Seok Jin...

1878
01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:18.018
- and So Min are included. - Thank you.

1879
01:09:18.018 --> 01:09:19.558
- I'll be fast. - Okay.

1880
01:09:19.558 --> 01:09:21.888
(I'll find it and reduce my sentence to half.)

1881
01:09:21.959 --> 01:09:23.428
- It starts as soon as I come out. - Okay.

1882
01:09:24.798 --> 01:09:27.069
Some people might get released right away with that.

1883
01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.268
I bet some people will.

1884
01:09:29.768 --> 01:09:31.739
(While Se Chan hides the tofu, they play a game.)

1885
01:09:31.739 --> 01:09:32.968
Should we start playing a game?

1886
01:09:32.968 --> 01:09:34.508
Yes, let's play Red Light, Green Light.

1887
01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:36.539
If I find that and make tofu,

1888
01:09:36.638 --> 01:09:38.209
my sentences becomes one-fourth?

1889
01:09:38.209 --> 01:09:39.978
You have to try your best, Kwang Soo.

1890
01:09:39.978 --> 01:09:41.779
I'll risk my life. All right.

1891
01:09:41.879 --> 01:09:44.249
- Be my partner, So Min. - Okay, I like that.

1892
01:09:44.249 --> 01:09:45.749
- Be my partner, Seok Jin. - Okay.

1893
01:09:45.879 --> 01:09:47.688
- We'll both be fine. - Okay.

1894
01:09:48.348 --> 01:09:49.548
- Let's go. - Okay.

1895
01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:50.758
Let's get started.

1896
01:09:51.258 --> 01:09:53.129
Lie down on the ground.

1897
01:09:53.129 --> 01:09:54.558
Red light, green light

1898
01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:58.129
(Lie down on the ground.)

1899
01:09:58.499 --> 01:10:00.598
(Collapsing)

1900
01:10:00.598 --> 01:10:01.699
Seok Jin is out.

1901
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.598
I'm sorry.

1902
01:10:05.398 --> 01:10:07.709
(He pretended to lie down.)

1903
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:10.239
- Seok Jin is out. - I'm sorry.

1904
01:10:10.478 --> 01:10:12.209
- You're out. - Goodness.

1905
01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:15.109
Haha went on his belly.

1906
01:10:15.109 --> 01:10:16.819
- No, I looked to my side. - He went on his belly.

1907
01:10:16.819 --> 01:10:18.279
- He went on his belly. - He did.

1908
01:10:18.379 --> 01:10:19.518
Haha is out.

1909
01:10:19.518 --> 01:10:20.648
(He's in an awkward position.)

1910
01:10:20.648 --> 01:10:23.359
Ji Hyo is on her side!

1911
01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:26.188
He never said to lie on your back. You just need to lie down.

1912
01:10:26.758 --> 01:10:28.388
- Are we done? - Yes.

1913
01:10:28.388 --> 01:10:30.629
- We should have another chance. - Go in when Se Chan comes out.

1914
01:10:31.699 --> 01:10:32.999
Next command.

1915
01:10:33.728 --> 01:10:35.228
Put your arms around each other's shoulders.

1916
01:10:35.228 --> 01:10:36.598
Red light, green light

1917
01:10:36.598 --> 01:10:39.338
(Put your arms around each other's shoulders.)

1918
01:10:39.338 --> 01:10:40.338
I didn't hear that.

1919
01:10:40.338 --> 01:10:41.838
I'm your partner.

1920
01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:43.808
(Arguing)

1921
01:10:43.808 --> 01:10:45.008
Jae Seok.

1922
01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:46.609
(They're still near the start line.)

1923
01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:49.249
- Jae Seok. - We have to go forward.

1924
01:10:50.148 --> 01:10:51.779
- Jae Seok. - Next instruction.

1925
01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.919
Make a sexy pose.

1926
01:10:53.919 --> 01:10:55.449
Red light, green light

1927
01:10:55.449 --> 01:10:58.218
(Make a sexy pose.)

1928
01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:01.258
(They try their best to be sexy.)

1929
01:11:01.529 --> 01:11:02.888
So Min is not sexy.

1930
01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:04.928
(He picks on So Min.)

1931
01:11:05.798 --> 01:11:09.898
(How's this? Is this sexy?)

1932
01:11:10.638 --> 01:11:13.468
(I approve.)

1933
01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.338
(4th instruction)

1934
01:11:16.478 --> 01:11:19.978
Grab each other by the collar. Red light, green light

1935
01:11:19.978 --> 01:11:22.909
(Grab each other by the collar.)

1936
01:11:22.909 --> 01:11:26.949
(Grabbing)

1937
01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.188
We have to go forward.

1938
01:11:28.388 --> 01:11:30.058
Get into a push-up position.

1939
01:11:30.188 --> 01:11:31.718
Red light, green light

1940
01:11:31.718 --> 01:11:33.329
(They move up a lot.)

1941
01:11:33.629 --> 01:11:34.728
Green light

1942
01:11:35.228 --> 01:11:36.428
So Min is in bare feet.

1943
01:11:36.428 --> 01:11:37.728
(So Min is very motivated. She's barefoot again.)

1944
01:11:38.699 --> 01:11:40.629
(Kwang Soo is slow.)

1945
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:41.699
Kwang Soo is out.

1946
01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:42.869
- You got caught. You're out. - Come.

1947
01:11:42.928 --> 01:11:43.968
You're out, Jae Seok.

1948
01:11:43.968 --> 01:11:45.499
- Kwang Soo is out. - Come.

1949
01:11:45.739 --> 01:11:47.508
Don't be so greedy, Kwang Soo.

1950
01:11:47.508 --> 01:11:49.039
Hurry up, Kwang Soo. We have the next instruction.

1951
01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.279
They're in push-up positions.

1952
01:11:51.008 --> 01:11:53.478
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1953
01:11:53.478 --> 01:11:54.609
Next instruction.

1954
01:11:54.879 --> 01:11:57.218
Touch your nose with your tongue. Red light, green light

1955
01:11:57.218 --> 01:12:00.119
Hey, how can you do that?

1956
01:12:01.319 --> 01:12:03.558
(How can you do that?)

1957
01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.688
Jae Seok is out. So Min did it.

1958
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:09.159
(Why can't you do this?)

1959
01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:10.159
Jae Seok is out.

1960
01:12:10.398 --> 01:12:11.728
My gosh.

1961
01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:13.569
This is impossible.

1962
01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:15.669
- Jae Seok is out. - Jae Seok is out.

1963
01:12:16.129 --> 01:12:17.938
Look at this guy.

1964
01:12:18.338 --> 01:12:20.569
My tongue doesn't touch my nose. I can't do it.

1965
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:21.968
They told me to do it.

1966
01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:23.079
Gosh...

1967
01:12:23.079 --> 01:12:24.138
Ready.

1968
01:12:24.138 --> 01:12:25.678
(He's done hiding the tofu.)

1969
01:12:25.678 --> 01:12:26.978
Set, go.

1970
01:12:27.449 --> 01:12:29.308
(He's done hiding the tofu on the 2nd floor.)

1971
01:12:29.308 --> 01:12:30.879
(Whoever finds it gets to have it.)

1972
01:12:30.978 --> 01:12:33.249
It's on the second floor.

1973
01:12:33.489 --> 01:12:34.888
Go wild. It's on the second floor.

1974
01:12:35.588 --> 01:12:36.758
I have to find this.

1975
01:12:36.758 --> 01:12:38.218
- I have to find this. - Me too.

1976
01:12:38.218 --> 01:12:39.789
(If you find the tofu, your sentence gets halved.)

1977
01:12:40.058 --> 01:12:41.388
(While they look for the tofu, the game continues outside.)

1978
01:12:41.388 --> 01:12:42.758
Where did he hide it?

1979
01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.159
(While they look for the tofu, the game continues outside.)

1980
01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.359
Where is it?

1981
01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:48.798
Make a cute face. Red light, green light

1982
01:12:49.739 --> 01:12:52.369
(They act cute.)

1983
01:12:52.898 --> 01:12:54.338
Make a heart...

1984
01:12:54.338 --> 01:12:56.338
(Ji Hyo touches his back.)

1985
01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:57.438
Red light, green light

1986
01:12:57.438 --> 01:13:01.579
(They have to run to the start line.)

1987
01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:02.749
Oh, dear.

1988
01:13:02.749 --> 01:13:04.579
(Falling)

1989
01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:08.718
(So Min shows slapstick humor.)

1990
01:13:09.659 --> 01:13:11.789
(Ji Hyo sprints back.)

1991
01:13:11.789 --> 01:13:12.959
Ji Hyo wins.

1992
01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:15.359
You can go look for the tofu.

1993
01:13:15.928 --> 01:13:17.928
I have no luck today.

1994
01:13:17.928 --> 01:13:19.029
So Min, you have no time.

1995
01:13:19.029 --> 01:13:20.468
Go up, and find the tofu.

1996
01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.268
Go on the second floor.

1997
01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:25.138
(Did they find it already?)

1998
01:13:25.138 --> 01:13:26.808
My socks are wet.

1999
01:13:26.808 --> 01:13:28.039
My shoes are wet too.

2000
01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:30.379
Why are you only looking in the cells?

2001
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:34.609
(Seok Jin takes out something.)

2002
01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:36.819
(He found the tofu.)

2003
01:13:37.048 --> 01:13:38.419
(A few minutes earlier)

2004
01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:43.919
(He found the tofu by the 2nd floor railing.)

2005
01:13:44.989 --> 01:13:46.588
- Goodness. - Where did it go?

2006
01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.688
(He hid it inside his clothes.)

2007
01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.058
(Giggling)

2008
01:13:51.428 --> 01:13:52.829
I have it.

2009
01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:54.428
You found it?

2010
01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:55.898
You found it?

2011
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:57.838
Where did you find it?

2012
01:13:57.838 --> 01:14:01.039
(Where was it?)

2013
01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:03.909
- Where did you find it? - You just put it there.

2014
01:14:03.909 --> 01:14:05.808
I did.

2015
01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:08.308
- You found out. - Your sentence...

2016
01:14:08.308 --> 01:14:10.048
is halved.

2017
01:14:10.619 --> 01:14:11.678
Okay.

2018
01:14:11.919 --> 01:14:13.648
Ji Hyo wins this game.

2019
01:14:13.648 --> 01:14:14.848
- Wow. - Good job.

2020
01:14:14.848 --> 01:14:17.018
You can switch your sentence with another person.

2021
01:14:17.518 --> 01:14:18.659
Before that...

2022
01:14:19.758 --> 01:14:21.859
- It's the cell leader. - Who?

2023
01:14:21.928 --> 01:14:23.129
Jae Seok is released.

2024
01:14:23.129 --> 01:14:24.999
(Jae Seok is released this time.)

2025
01:14:25.359 --> 01:14:27.298
- Jae Seok. - I knew it would be him.

2026
01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:30.539
(He picked 4 hours,)

2027
01:14:30.539 --> 01:14:33.308
(the 3rd shortest sentence.)

2028
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:38.478
There's another person who is soon-to-be released.

2029
01:14:38.539 --> 01:14:40.079
- There's another person? - Yes.

2030
01:14:40.548 --> 01:14:42.508
(I want to switch with that person.)

2031
01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:44.678
Let's go. Friends.

2032
01:14:44.678 --> 01:14:45.919
Change your clothes.

2033
01:14:45.919 --> 01:14:47.148
(I'm going back into society.)

2034
01:14:47.148 --> 01:14:48.848
Friends, I...

2035
01:14:48.848 --> 01:14:51.258
It's Jong Kook. Run.

2036
01:14:51.789 --> 01:14:53.188
(Have some tofu.)

2037
01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:54.258
Jong Kook!

2038
01:14:54.888 --> 01:14:56.228
It's Jong Kook. He has tofu.

2039
01:14:56.228 --> 01:14:58.159
- Jong Kook! - Jong Kook!

2040
01:14:58.258 --> 01:14:59.968
- Jong Kook. - Please.

2041
01:14:59.968 --> 01:15:01.728
I beg you. Please.

2042
01:15:01.928 --> 01:15:03.638
Jong Kook.

2043
01:15:03.638 --> 01:15:05.338
- Jong Kook. - Please.

2044
01:15:05.739 --> 01:15:07.669
- My sentence is so long. - Let's go.

2045
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.239
- Jong Kook. - I have 10 to 11 hours.

2046
01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:10.678
- Jong Kook. - What did you do?

2047
01:15:10.678 --> 01:15:12.409
The tofu is here.

2048
01:15:12.409 --> 01:15:14.848
- Where's my tofu? Who did this? - He has tofu.

2049
01:15:14.848 --> 01:15:16.449
Somebody took it.

2050
01:15:16.919 --> 01:15:19.478
- Go to Jong Kook. - Somebody took my tofu.

2051
01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:26.388
(She checked her tofu a few minutes earlier.)

2052
01:15:27.258 --> 01:15:30.629
(Why is there a white towel instead of tofu?)

2053
01:15:30.829 --> 01:15:33.569
(So Min's missing tofu case)

2054
01:15:34.468 --> 01:15:36.438
(I know. It was you, right?)

2055
01:15:36.438 --> 01:15:39.039
- I don't even know where it is. - Jae Seok.

2056
01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:41.438
It's you, right? It's Jae Seok.

2057
01:15:41.438 --> 01:15:42.539
(Suspect 1 is Jae Seok who just got released.)

2058
01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:44.539
It's not me.

2059
01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:47.048
Think about those who didn't leave to look for the tofu.

2060
01:15:47.249 --> 01:15:48.478
- Give it back. - It's not me.

2061
01:15:48.478 --> 01:15:49.779
(Suspect 2 is Kwang Soo who was left here alone.)

2062
01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:51.249
- Give it back. - Find it for her.

2063
01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:54.088
It's not me. This is not fair.

2064
01:15:54.188 --> 01:15:55.848
Who took my tofu?

2065
01:15:55.848 --> 01:15:58.319
I was playing the game, and they put a towel in here.

2066
01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:01.489
- How many years do you have? - Kwang Soo.

2067
01:16:01.489 --> 01:16:02.728
Is it the same as before?

2068
01:16:02.728 --> 01:16:04.258
It is. Only an hour has passed.

2069
01:16:04.258 --> 01:16:05.258
Here.

2070
01:16:05.258 --> 01:16:11.039
(Take this tofu, So Min.)

2071
01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:15.268
(Jong Kook, you're giving this to me?)

2072
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:18.709
- He's being nice. - I switched...

2073
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:20.178
with her.

2074
01:16:20.178 --> 01:16:22.449
- Jong Kook. - He switched with you.

2075
01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.449
You're acting so warm.

2076
01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:26.388
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - It's nothing.

2077
01:16:27.218 --> 01:16:29.718
I worked so hard to make that tofu.

2078
01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.258
I know. Good job.

2079
01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:33.529
But that tall jerk...

2080
01:16:33.529 --> 01:16:35.489
(That tall jerk took it.)

2081
01:16:35.489 --> 01:16:37.029
It's not me, punk.

2082
01:16:37.728 --> 01:16:39.159
Hey, don't fight.

2083
01:16:39.359 --> 01:16:41.098
- What's going on? - What was that?

2084
01:16:41.098 --> 01:16:42.829
I hope they kiss.

2085
01:16:42.928 --> 01:16:44.569
My tofu, gosh.

2086
01:16:44.598 --> 01:16:46.169
It's not me.

2087
01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:47.669
Who is it?

2088
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:50.079
You'll get punished. I hope three generations of your family fail.

2089
01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:51.638
- Goodness. - What?

2090
01:16:51.638 --> 01:16:53.848
(That wasn't nice.)

2091
01:16:53.848 --> 01:16:54.949
Don't say that.

2092
01:16:55.109 --> 01:16:56.749
You went too far.

2093
01:16:56.749 --> 01:16:58.249
(Kwang Soo overreacts to what she did.)

2094
01:16:58.779 --> 01:17:02.348
(When So Min left to find Se Chan's tofu...)

2095
01:17:02.348 --> 01:17:04.659
(He moves slowly.)

2096
01:17:05.619 --> 01:17:08.029
(He takes the tofu.)

2097
01:17:08.029 --> 01:17:09.058
Lee Kwang Soo.

2098
01:17:10.098 --> 01:17:12.199
I'm done. It's complete.

2099
01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:13.999
It's been over 30 minutes.

2100
01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:15.869
I can't believe he's doing this.

2101
01:17:16.129 --> 01:17:17.338
Kwang Soo,

2102
01:17:17.338 --> 01:17:19.499
you submitted a tofu,

2103
01:17:19.499 --> 01:17:21.669
- so your sentence is halved. - Yes!

2104
01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:26.548
(He switched the tofu with a towel.)

2105
01:17:27.308 --> 01:17:28.609
(We'll see about this.)

2106
01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:30.079
- It's not me. - All right.

2107
01:17:30.348 --> 01:17:32.018
At this time,

2108
01:17:32.018 --> 01:17:35.548
Ji Hyo has a chance to switch with another person.

2109
01:17:35.619 --> 01:17:37.359
The person who is going to be released soon...

2110
01:17:37.359 --> 01:17:39.728
- has 15 minutes left. - It's almost time.

2111
01:17:39.728 --> 01:17:41.728
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's not me.

2112
01:17:41.728 --> 01:17:43.029
- Don't pick me. - It's him.

2113
01:17:43.029 --> 01:17:44.758
The person with the longest sentence...

2114
01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.428
has seven hours.

2115
01:17:47.428 --> 01:17:48.999
- Oh, dear. Are you all right? - Who is it?

2116
01:17:49.199 --> 01:17:50.268
It's So Min.

2117
01:17:50.739 --> 01:17:52.968
- Is that after being halved? - It is her.

2118
01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.069
- No. - It's not.

2119
01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.808
If she gets halved, she only has around five hours.

2120
01:17:56.808 --> 01:17:58.138
It's not her.

2121
01:17:58.138 --> 01:18:00.678
There's another person with seven hours. It's the longest.

2122
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:03.879
- Seven hours? - We don't have any more games left.

2123
01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:05.749
You have to make a good decision, Ji Hyo.

2124
01:18:05.779 --> 01:18:06.949
You have to make a good decision.

2125
01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:08.419
If you pick seven hours, that's the end.

2126
01:18:08.419 --> 01:18:10.859
Hold on, Ji Hyo.

2127
01:18:10.859 --> 01:18:12.888
- Can you let me investigate? - Sure.

2128
01:18:13.129 --> 01:18:15.258
- Everybody. - Who are you?

2129
01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:17.598
- I am... - You got released. You're done.

2130
01:18:17.598 --> 01:18:19.669
- Get lost. - Go away.

2131
01:18:20.098 --> 01:18:22.699
Get away from my house. You're irrelevant.

2132
01:18:22.869 --> 01:18:24.239
Can I borrow your coat?

2133
01:18:25.638 --> 01:18:29.008
(Jae Seok tries again with a detective look.)

2134
01:18:29.008 --> 01:18:30.609
- These people... - Go away, you beggar.

2135
01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.579
You came as a beggar.

2136
01:18:32.579 --> 01:18:35.008
(Yelling)

2137
01:18:35.879 --> 01:18:37.348
You look like a beggar.

2138
01:18:37.348 --> 01:18:39.148
- I think so too. - It's true.

2139
01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:41.148
- Did it? - It kind of did.

2140
01:18:41.148 --> 01:18:42.619
- A little bit. - Just a bit.

2141
01:18:42.989 --> 01:18:44.758
Ji Hyo, you have to decide.

2142
01:18:44.758 --> 01:18:46.829
What's the shortest sentence left?

2143
01:18:46.829 --> 01:18:48.188
15 minutes. It's 10 minutes now.

2144
01:18:48.188 --> 01:18:50.859
It's not So Min. She's not a suspect.

2145
01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:54.268
The most important thing is that somebody took her tofu.

2146
01:18:54.268 --> 01:18:55.629
I think it's Kwang Soo.

2147
01:18:55.768 --> 01:18:56.768
- He ate it. - I'm 100-percent sure.

2148
01:18:56.768 --> 01:18:58.039
Consider the circumstance.

2149
01:18:58.169 --> 01:18:59.638
- He was smacking his lips. - I didn't eat anything.

2150
01:18:59.638 --> 01:19:01.209
Look at my mouth. Check it.

2151
01:19:01.508 --> 01:19:03.739
- Check my mouth. - Hold on. There's a piece stuck.

2152
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.308
(She opens his mouth wide.)

2153
01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:10.619
(Let me see where my tofu is.)

2154
01:19:10.619 --> 01:19:12.678
- Hold on. - I didn't eat it.

2155
01:19:12.779 --> 01:19:14.449
- There's a piece of tofu. - That's from earlier.

2156
01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.619
- I didn't eat it. - It's definitely him.

2157
01:19:16.619 --> 01:19:17.989
You still have the tofu from earlier?

2158
01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:19.659
Think about it, Ji Hyo.

2159
01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:21.489
You don't need to hesitate.

2160
01:19:21.489 --> 01:19:23.699
Let me tell the truth.

2161
01:19:24.098 --> 01:19:25.798
I have seven hours left. Pick me if you want.

2162
01:19:25.798 --> 01:19:26.968
(Is he confessing?)

2163
01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:32.039
(Is this Kwang Soo's timer?)

2164
01:19:32.039 --> 01:19:34.739
Pick me if you want. I have nothing to lose.

2165
01:19:34.739 --> 01:19:35.808
- Pick him. - Hey.

2166
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.008
- I have seven hours left. - Think about it.

2167
01:19:37.008 --> 01:19:40.178
- She just smiled. - Ji Hyo.

2168
01:19:40.178 --> 01:19:42.008
(Hold on. What does that smile mean?)

2169
01:19:42.008 --> 01:19:45.518
(This morning when they were selecting their sentences)

2170
01:19:46.018 --> 01:19:50.018
(The person who picked 10 hours, the 2nd longest sentence...)

2171
01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:53.789
(was Ji Hyo.)

2172
01:19:54.659 --> 01:19:57.258
(She has 7 hours left. She laughs at Kwang Soo's lie.)

2173
01:19:57.258 --> 01:19:58.699
- I have seven hours left. - Ji Hyo.

2174
01:19:58.699 --> 01:20:00.499
This is the decisive hint.

2175
01:20:00.499 --> 01:20:01.669
Pick him. I'm sure.

2176
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:03.069
You don't have seven hours, right?

2177
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:04.869
- I have seven hours left. - No.

2178
01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:06.039
- Hold on. - I'm sure.

2179
01:20:06.039 --> 01:20:07.369
- What is your decision, Ji Hyo? - Hold on.

2180
01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:08.638
- Wait. - Do it.

2181
01:20:08.638 --> 01:20:10.379
- Is it you? - Don't feel pressured.

2182
01:20:10.379 --> 01:20:12.209
- Kwang Soo. - Yes.

2183
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:14.648
(She switches with Kwang Soo.)

2184
01:20:14.648 --> 01:20:16.949
As long as I'm not in last place. It's okay.

2185
01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:18.848
You're not in last place.

2186
01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:22.018
Ji Hyo, we'll show you the time left.

2187
01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.558
Kwang Soo, we'll give you yours too.

2188
01:20:23.558 --> 01:20:26.018
- In three, you'll show everybody. - How much did you have left?

2189
01:20:26.018 --> 01:20:29.459
- We'll show everybody? - In 1, 2, 3.

2190
01:20:31.659 --> 01:20:35.098
(1 hour and 3 minutes)

2191
01:20:35.098 --> 01:20:37.098
Kwang Soo said he had seven hours.

2192
01:20:37.938 --> 01:20:38.938
1 hour.

2193
01:20:39.808 --> 01:20:41.438
(He does have 7 hours and 10 minutes now.)

2194
01:20:41.438 --> 01:20:43.338
- 1 hour. - Kwang Soo.

2195
01:20:44.909 --> 01:20:46.379
You had seven hours?

2196
01:20:46.648 --> 01:20:48.109
(Thanks, Kwang Soo.)

2197
01:20:48.478 --> 01:20:50.579
That's why you smiled.

2198
01:20:51.048 --> 01:20:53.548
(Kwang Soo comes in last place for stealing and lying.)

2199
01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:56.688
I knew it. You thief.

2200
01:20:56.688 --> 01:20:58.258
- You had seven hours. - You ate it, right?

2201
01:20:58.258 --> 01:21:00.588
- It was you, right? - I didn't eat it. I submitted it.

2202
01:21:00.588 --> 01:21:02.688
- Hey. - It was finished. I submitted it.

2203
01:21:02.999 --> 01:21:04.859
- See? I told you. - I know.

2204
01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:07.398
You have seven hours?

2205
01:21:07.398 --> 01:21:08.999
I have seven hours.

2206
01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:12.169
What a thief.

2207
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:13.539
Still, I was close.

2208
01:21:13.539 --> 01:21:15.638
Three generations of your family will fail.

2209
01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:16.678
Shut your mouth.

2210
01:21:17.409 --> 01:21:19.008
I'll marry you then.

2211
01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:21.209
(Our family can fail then!)

2212
01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.218
- What? - What was that?

2213
01:21:23.218 --> 01:21:25.218
- Was that a proposal? - Was it?

2214
01:21:25.319 --> 01:21:27.919
I just got nauseous.

2215
01:21:27.919 --> 01:21:29.218
(I'm against this marriage.)

2216
01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:30.619
(It's not that bad.)

2217
01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.289
I'm just saying.

2218
01:21:33.659 --> 01:21:36.798
(Jail time is over after the unexpected proposal.)

2219
01:21:36.798 --> 01:21:39.398
The rest of you can be released.

2220
01:21:39.398 --> 01:21:41.098
- Can we go? - Are they all leaving?

2221
01:21:41.098 --> 01:21:43.268
Kwang Soo,

2222
01:21:43.569 --> 01:21:45.369
make tofu for seven hours.

2223
01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:46.838
By himself?

2224
01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.209
You'll be left alone with your cameraman...

2225
01:21:49.209 --> 01:21:51.838
and do self-bathing. You'll be released then.

2226
01:21:51.838 --> 01:21:54.209
I did most of the work.

2227
01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.518
So Min used all of it, so I submitted it.

2228
01:21:57.148 --> 01:21:59.079
- You submitted it? - Yes.

2229
01:21:59.419 --> 01:22:02.619
Then Kwang Soo, have a great rest of the time.

2230
01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:04.859
- We'll visit. - We will.

2231
01:22:05.319 --> 01:22:06.388
Take care.

2232
01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:09.188
- Go back, Kwang Soo. - Can they buy me tofu?

2233
01:22:09.289 --> 01:22:10.398
They can.

2234
01:22:10.398 --> 01:22:12.329
- I have plans today. - What plans?

2235
01:22:12.329 --> 01:22:14.829
(I can't come.)

2236
01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:16.468
Where do you have to be?

2237
01:22:17.069 --> 01:22:18.298
- I'm sorry. - With whom?

2238
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:20.909
- And I have no money. - What do you mean?

2239
01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:24.638
I'll transfer you the money. Get me some tofu.

2240
01:22:24.779 --> 01:22:26.178
I didn't bring my wallet.

2241
01:22:26.178 --> 01:22:29.879
If you buy me tofu, I won't forget your kindness.

2242
01:22:30.419 --> 01:22:31.478
I won't forget it.

2243
01:22:31.478 --> 01:22:32.919
- I don't trust you. - Do you think anybody will?

2244
01:22:32.919 --> 01:22:34.888
It doesn't benefit us in any way.

2245
01:22:34.888 --> 01:22:37.588
- Let's leave. - Shall we go?

2246
01:22:37.588 --> 01:22:39.629
Kwang Soo, please return to the same cell.

2247
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:41.289
- I don't want to go. - Take care.

2248
01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:44.558
Please help me. I'm sorry. I won't steal again.

2249
01:22:44.558 --> 01:22:46.798
- Give me one chance. - Make a tofu.

2250
01:22:46.798 --> 01:22:48.569
- Give me another chance. - Hope that they buy you tofu.

2251
01:22:48.569 --> 01:22:50.638
Please buy me 1. Just 1.

2252
01:22:50.938 --> 01:22:52.438
They are all leaving!

2253
01:22:54.968 --> 01:22:58.779
(The thief, Kwang Soo, gets imprisoned again.)

2254
01:22:58.879 --> 01:23:00.749
How am I supposed to make this?

2255
01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:01.978
(His only friend for 7 hours is the millstone.)

2256
01:23:02.449 --> 01:23:04.779
How do I make this? Do I have to self-bathe too?

2257
01:23:05.478 --> 01:23:09.249
(The self-bathing system is ready.)

2258
01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:11.459
My goodness. When will I finish?

2259
01:23:12.218 --> 01:23:13.258
I'm sorry.

2260
01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:16.058
What's wrong with you?

2261
01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:18.758
What did I do? What did I...

2262
01:23:19.768 --> 01:23:22.999
- Why do you keep committing crimes? - No, that's not why.

2263
01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:24.338
(His cameraman is mad at him.)

2264
01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:26.199
I shouldn't have said I had seven hours left.

2265
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:28.808
This is driving me nuts.

2266
01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:32.239
(Spinning)

2267
01:23:32.239 --> 01:23:33.449
When will I grind all this?

2268
01:23:33.449 --> 01:23:36.978
(He keeps on spinning it, but the soybeans don't go away.)

2269
01:23:37.079 --> 01:23:40.619
(What did I do so wrong?)

2270
01:23:42.789 --> 01:23:44.919
To make this...

2271
01:23:45.018 --> 01:23:46.088
Jae Seok!

2272
01:23:46.989 --> 01:23:49.029
(He comes back.)

2273
01:23:49.329 --> 01:23:52.928
(Kwang Soo, I got you tofu.)

2274
01:23:54.428 --> 01:23:55.999
- Kwang Soo. - Jae Seok.

2275
01:23:56.369 --> 01:23:57.569
You punk.

2276
01:23:57.569 --> 01:23:59.039
- Jae Seok. - You are still here.

2277
01:23:59.438 --> 01:24:01.209
I'm sorry.

2278
01:24:01.468 --> 01:24:02.869
I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

2279
01:24:02.978 --> 01:24:04.609
- I felt this for the first time. - Kwang Soo.

2280
01:24:04.609 --> 01:24:06.109
I felt like this for the first time.

2281
01:24:06.648 --> 01:24:07.779
You punk.

2282
01:24:08.449 --> 01:24:11.579
- You can't commit crimes. - I'm sorry.

2283
01:24:12.079 --> 01:24:14.848
- Your parents are watching you! - I'm sorry.

2284
01:24:16.018 --> 01:24:17.188
- Kwang Soo. - Yes.

2285
01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:18.588
I knew you'd come.

2286
01:24:18.588 --> 01:24:20.789
- I never doubted it. - You punk...

2287
01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:23.859
(They're absorbed in their act.)

2288
01:24:24.398 --> 01:24:25.898
- Thank you, Jae Seok. - Here.

2289
01:24:25.898 --> 01:24:27.428
- You're fine. - Thank you.

2290
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:30.039
- It's all good. - Give it to me.

2291
01:24:30.039 --> 01:24:32.138
This is enough.

2292
01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:34.638
Thank you. I committed a big crime.

2293
01:24:34.638 --> 01:24:35.768
Give me a spoon.

2294
01:24:36.808 --> 01:24:38.409
I repented for everything.

2295
01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:40.548
(You don't have to feed me.)

2296
01:24:40.548 --> 01:24:42.478
- My gosh. - I'm sorry.

2297
01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:43.919
Thanks.

2298
01:24:44.678 --> 01:24:45.749
Sorry?

2299
01:24:45.749 --> 01:24:47.319
I'm going to eat this on my way home.

2300
01:24:47.319 --> 01:24:49.619
(Thanks for the spoon.)

2301
01:24:50.888 --> 01:24:52.789
(Give me the tofu.)

2302
01:24:54.129 --> 01:24:55.489
What are you saying?

2303
01:24:55.489 --> 01:24:57.629
What are you doing?

2304
01:24:58.029 --> 01:25:01.228
- Really? - Jong Kook got this earlier.

2305
01:25:01.499 --> 01:25:04.039
- I wanted to eat it on my way. - Why would you do that?

2306
01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:07.409
Buy one on your way home! Give this to me!

2307
01:25:07.739 --> 01:25:09.308
- Jae Seok. - If you give it to him,

2308
01:25:09.308 --> 01:25:10.678
he has 3 hours and 10 minutes left.

2309
01:25:10.678 --> 01:25:13.779
(His sentence will be shortened to 3 hours and 10 minutes.)

2310
01:25:13.779 --> 01:25:14.779
This is...

2311
01:25:16.048 --> 01:25:17.478
enough.

2312
01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:19.648
- Are you giving it to him? - Yes.

2313
01:25:19.648 --> 01:25:21.319
Thank you. Thank you, Jae Seok.

2314
01:25:21.548 --> 01:25:24.789
Kwang Soo, you have 3 hours and 10 minutes left.

2315
01:25:24.789 --> 01:25:26.218
Thank you.

2316
01:25:26.218 --> 01:25:27.258
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2317
01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.758
- Be good. - Okay.

2318
01:25:28.758 --> 01:25:29.959
- Don't betray people. - Okay.

2319
01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:31.228
- I won't steal. - Don't, okay?

2320
01:25:31.228 --> 01:25:32.428
- Don't steal people's stuff. - Okay.

2321
01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:33.499
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

2322
01:25:33.598 --> 01:25:35.728
- I'll be good. - It's cold.

2323
01:25:35.728 --> 01:25:37.638
I'll finish my sentence and get back.

2324
01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:40.369
That's right. Finish the three hours.

2325
01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:41.438
- All right? - Yes.

2326
01:25:41.739 --> 01:25:43.079
- Thank you! - No worries.

2327
01:25:43.079 --> 01:25:45.609
- I'll repay my debt of gratitude. - Okay.

2328
01:25:46.579 --> 01:25:48.308
- All right, Kwang Soo. - Please take care!

2329
01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:49.749
- Okay. - Thank you.

2330
01:25:50.279 --> 01:25:51.749
You don't know how to make it, right?

2331
01:25:51.949 --> 01:25:53.018
Isn't this how you do it?

2332
01:25:53.289 --> 01:25:55.348
I'm done. I have to boil this.

2333
01:25:55.949 --> 01:25:56.989
Haha!

2334
01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:02.029
(He once again pretends like he's born again.)

2335
01:26:02.029 --> 01:26:04.359
You're not like that, right?

2336
01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.728
I was a fool.

2337
01:26:06.699 --> 01:26:08.169
I wanted to get out.

2338
01:26:08.169 --> 01:26:09.569
(I have changed.)

2339
01:26:09.569 --> 01:26:10.598
I'm sorry.

2340
01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:15.709
- I'll take care of your parents. - What?

2341
01:26:16.879 --> 01:26:18.838
My dad and my mom? Why?

2342
01:26:19.779 --> 01:26:21.508
Don't worry. I'm a loyal person.

2343
01:26:22.409 --> 01:26:24.919
Are you empty... Are you empty-handed?

2344
01:26:25.178 --> 01:26:27.388
Haha. Hold on.

2345
01:26:29.548 --> 01:26:31.959
(I'll see you back in society.)

2346
01:26:31.959 --> 01:26:33.088
Haha!

2347
01:26:35.428 --> 01:26:36.558
What did you do?

2348
01:26:37.728 --> 01:26:38.999
Be good.

2349
01:26:38.999 --> 01:26:41.199
(Thanks to Haha, his sentence is reduced to 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

2350
01:26:41.199 --> 01:26:42.369
Be good.

2351
01:26:46.468 --> 01:26:48.268
Seok Jin! My gosh.

2352
01:26:48.869 --> 01:26:51.178
My mom keeps on asking why I'm not coming home.

2353
01:26:53.678 --> 01:26:54.978
- Feeling! - Intuition!

2354
01:26:54.978 --> 01:26:56.109
- Cross! - Cross!

2355
01:26:56.319 --> 01:26:58.648
- Good job. - Ji Hyo!

2356
01:26:59.148 --> 01:27:00.588
- Thank you. - Do your best.

2357
01:27:00.588 --> 01:27:02.249
Thank you. Okay.

2358
01:27:02.388 --> 01:27:03.558
So this...

2359
01:27:03.558 --> 01:27:04.688
(He's almost done. He focuses on making tofu.)

2360
01:27:04.688 --> 01:27:05.758
The stove...

2361
01:27:08.758 --> 01:27:10.029
Does this become that?

2362
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:13.169
This becomes that when I boil it?

2363
01:27:13.898 --> 01:27:16.798
(That doesn't look like tofu.)

2364
01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:17.999
This is tofu?

2365
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:20.768
Kwang Soo.

2366
01:27:21.739 --> 01:27:24.678
(Kwang Soo)

2367
01:27:24.978 --> 01:27:29.109
(Her warmth makes him regret about his mistakes and betrayal.)

2368
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:30.478
Kwang Soo.

2369
01:27:30.919 --> 01:27:33.088
How could you lie to me so shamelessly?

2370
01:27:33.218 --> 01:27:35.048
- I'm sorry. - I'm not that gullible,

2371
01:27:35.048 --> 01:27:36.819
- I regret it. - but you tricked me.

2372
01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:37.859
(I reflected on myself.)

2373
01:27:37.859 --> 01:27:39.419
Please give me another chance. I'm sorry.

2374
01:27:41.728 --> 01:27:42.959
Cry.

2375
01:27:43.499 --> 01:27:45.199
Cry. Let me see you cry.

2376
01:27:45.598 --> 01:27:47.298
If I see a drop of tear, I'll give it to you.

2377
01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:48.728
Goodness.

2378
01:27:48.728 --> 01:27:50.739
(She provokes him.)

2379
01:27:51.638 --> 01:27:52.898
Kwang Soo, you are released.

2380
01:27:52.898 --> 01:27:55.539
(His sentence has expired.)

2381
01:27:57.638 --> 01:27:58.779
(Come back, you punk.)

2382
01:27:58.779 --> 01:28:00.449
Hey, come back.

2383
01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:01.749
- What did you say? - Kwang Soo.

2384
01:28:02.048 --> 01:28:03.348
Take your tofu, and get lost.

2385
01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:05.379
Take it, and get lost. I don't need it.

2386
01:28:05.379 --> 01:28:06.819
- Don't throw it at me. - It's for you.

2387
01:28:06.819 --> 01:28:08.048
I got released.

2388
01:28:08.218 --> 01:28:10.659
- I brought it for you. - I don't want it.

2389
01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:13.129
This is for making stew. I can't eat it.

2390
01:28:13.529 --> 01:28:16.728
Everybody gave me regular ones. Only you got me this.

2391
01:28:16.728 --> 01:28:17.829
(If he didn't get out, she would have made him eat it.)

2392
01:28:17.829 --> 01:28:18.859
(Congratulations on your release.)

2393
01:28:18.859 --> 01:28:21.428
Kwang Soo, take a self-bath,

2394
01:28:21.798 --> 01:28:23.169
and go home.

2395
01:28:23.438 --> 01:28:26.069
For the rest of my life, I'll serve others...

2396
01:28:26.938 --> 01:28:29.569
and live cleanly. Thank you.

2397
01:28:30.909 --> 01:28:32.508
There's a button. You can press it.

2398
01:28:32.508 --> 01:28:33.909
I'm talking right now.

2399
01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.548
I'm talking.

2400
01:28:35.548 --> 01:28:36.879
I'm sorry.

2401
01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:39.018
It's difficult to come here the 1st time, but not the 2nd time.

2402
01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:40.919
- I'm sorry. - Okay?

2403

(A water bomb for one person stands in a lonesome way.)

2404

(One man exits the prison to receive the penalty.)

2405
01:28:55.268 --> 01:29:00.369
(Goodbye, prison. A bath is bound to change me.)

2406
01:29:00.438 --> 01:29:02.508
It's a do-it-yourself penalty.

2407
01:29:03.008 --> 01:29:04.379
You need to speak louder because there is no microphone.

2408
01:29:04.379 --> 01:29:06.209
There is no microphone.

2409
01:29:06.209 --> 01:29:07.348
(There are only 1 producer and 1 cameraman on the set.)

2410
01:29:07.348 --> 01:29:08.909
It's a do-it-yourself penalty.

2411
01:29:08.909 --> 01:29:09.919
(There are only 1 producer and 1 cameraman on the set.)

2412
01:29:12.419 --> 01:29:13.919
Don't you think this is too cruel?

2413
01:29:15.048 --> 01:29:17.758
- I need to press it myself? - Yes, the button is next to you.

2414
01:29:19.829 --> 01:29:22.688
(The water comes out when he presses the button.)

2415
01:29:23.329 --> 01:29:24.659
I am sorry, viewers.

2416
01:29:26.058 --> 01:29:30.268
I will pay penance and start a new life.

2417
01:29:31.268 --> 01:29:35.508
If you lie or steal,

2418
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:37.239
you will receive a penalty.

2419
01:29:38.478 --> 01:29:39.579
I am sorry.

2420
01:29:39.579 --> 01:29:41.178
(I am sorry, viewers.)

2421
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:45.079

2423
01:29:52.989 --> 01:29:53.989
I am sorry!

2424
01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:55.058
(He feels like his sins are washed away.)

2425
01:29:55.058 --> 01:29:56.629
I won't do it again.

2426

(Screaming)

2427
01:29:59.699 --> 01:30:00.829
No one is here.

2428
01:30:02.428 --> 01:30:03.838
Where do I need to go?

2429
01:30:05.338 --> 01:30:06.369
Kwang Soo.

2430
01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:08.369
Please clap for the slate.

2431
01:30:09.008 --> 01:30:12.279
(Don't make fun of me!)

2432
01:30:17.548 --> 01:30:19.848
(Waddling)

2433
01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:21.548
I will clap.
