<i>[Episode 5]
[Longing Heart]</i>

3
00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:27.314
What?

4
00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:28.832
See who before I go, now?

5
00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.524
He's like a mouse who's
considerate of the cat.

6
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.851
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

7
00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:41.567
<i>Mr. Kang!</i>

8
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:55.610
<i>what if I do that...</i>

9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.175
<i>and end up not wanting
to leave, forever?</i>

10
00:01:00.314 --> 00:01:02.576
<i>What is he planning to do then?</i>

11
00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:06.884
<i>[Han Ji Soo]</i>

12
00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:08.398
<i>Let's go back.</i>

13
00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:11.588
<i>Because...</i>

14
00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.877
<i>Ji Soo will definitely be
waiting for me there.</i>

15
00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:20.916
<i>Because this definitely won't be
the last time that I see her.</i>

16
00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:24.041
<i>Because I'll be able to see her again.</i>

17
00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:00.404
Mr. Kang.

18
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.955
Are you really quitting?

19
00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:15.511
So Kang Shin Woo told you, huh?

20
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.049
By any chance...
Is it because of me?

21
00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:22.212
Is it because I make you
feel uncomfortable, and...

22
00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:24.613
Look at you,
saying unnecessary things again!

23
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.800
It's just that something came up

24
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.801
so I'm leaving without
much prior notice, is all.

25
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.860
Where are you going?

26
00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.920
This won't be the last time
I see you, right, Mr. Kang?

27
00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:38.800
Let's make a promise...

28
00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:41.704
to meet again one day, for sure.

29
00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.123
There's one final thing
that I wanted to say to you.

30
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.134
Sometimes, you can be wrong or misguided
when it comes to your own feelings.

31
00:03:02.134 --> 00:03:04.970
And so, you can end up
deceiving yourself.

32
00:03:06.327 --> 00:03:07.670
But...

33
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.200
this part of you
never lies.

34
00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:16.747
So look deep into your heart and
figure out who it is that you truly like.

35
00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:18.992
Because, when you do...

36
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:22.250
this part of you, right here,
will send you a signal.

37
00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.498
Thanks for everything up until now.

38
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.262
<i>Thanks...</i>

39
00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.564
<i>for liking me.</i>

40
00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:53.982
<i>I mean it.
Thanks so much.</i>

41
00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:58.838
You have to take care now, okay?

42
00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:01.311
Until we meet again.

43
00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:27.750
<i>Thank you.
Really.</i>

44
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.849
<i>Thank you.</i>

45
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:32.640
<i>Thank you.</i>

46
00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:37.226
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

47
00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.094
<i>Didn't you have thoughts
like this, too...</i>

48
00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:44.830
when you liked your
first love, Mr. Kang?

49
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.644
<i>Things like, "I wish I could be alone
with that person for just one day."</i>

50
00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:52.546
<i>Mr. Kang.</i>

51
00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:55.279
<i>I won't...</i>

52
00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:59.036
<i>make you feel uncomfortable anymore.</i>

53
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.791
<i>Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not crying because I was wrong.</i>

54
00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:05.715
<i>I also knew...</i>

55
00:05:05.715 --> 00:05:07.099
that this was the correct answer.

56
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.094
<i>But I can't help it.</i>

57
00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:14.140
<i>Sometimes, you can be wrong or misguided
when it comes to your own feelings.</i>

58
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.734
<i>And so, you can end up
deceiving yourself.</i>

59
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.546
<i>But...</i>

60
00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.830
this part of you
never lies.

61
00:05:22.334 --> 00:05:26.472
So look deep into your heart and
figure out who it is that you truly like.

62
00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.777
Because, when you do...

63
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.923
this part of you, right here,
will send you a signal.

64
00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:48.296
You quit your job at the school?

65
00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:50.395
That's why I'm wandering
around like this today.

66
00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:53.282
So this is what an unemployed
person's afternoon is like? It's nice.

67
00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:54.443
Oh, come now.

68
00:05:54.443 --> 00:05:57.198
Your mind will just start wandering since
you'll be bored with nothing to do.

69
00:05:57.198 --> 00:05:58.382
There's nothing good about that.

70
00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:01.236
I was always really busy,
ever since I graduated high school.

71
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.407
I had to work at part-time jobs
while attending school.

72
00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:05.974
Then I went to the military,
graduated, and got a job.

73
00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:09.698
It's the first time I've ever relaxed
on a weekday afternoon like this.

74
00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:12.613
Wow, you sure lived
a diligent life, Mr. Kang!

75
00:06:12.613 --> 00:06:15.685
I don't know who your mother is,
but she must be so proud of you!

76
00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.503
I'd be so happy if she were.

77
00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:19.729
I lived my life in a diligent way so that
my mother could look down at me

78
00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.245
and be proud of me.

79
00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:23.933
Oh, you're such a filial son, Mr. Kang!

80
00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:25.616
Oh, I'm in the mood for
a little bit of fun!

81
00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:28.986
Want to do a bit of day-drinking with me
since neither of us have plans today?

82
00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:30.058
I'd love to!

83
00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:31.061
I'll make you some fish cake soup!

84
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:32.214
- Fish cake soup?
- Yes!

85
00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:34.791
Let's hurry and go!
Thank you so much!

86
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.693
So, did you play
two women at once?

87
00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.390
I told you, I've liked only
one woman for ten years!

88
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.527
You borrowed money from her,
then, didn't you?

89
00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:46.128
What reason would I have had to borrow
money from a girl, at 18 years old?

90
00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:47.858
Oh, I'm so curious!

91
00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:50.750
Why did your first love tell you,
"I don't want to see you again"

92
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.880
after seeing you for the first time
in ten years, then?

93
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.390
And go as far as to say that you two
were bad for each other?

94
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.587
Her words exactly!

95
00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:59.662
But now, things went well with her
which is why you're going back, right?

96
00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:01.989
Well, it's a bit complicated.

97
00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:04.816
It's not exactly all resolved
at this very moment

98
00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:07.080
but I'm guessing that
everything will be all right

99
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.421
when I get back and see her.

100
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.760
That's my guess, anyway.

101
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.815
I seriously have no idea
what young people mean

102
00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:13.868
when they talk about their love lives!

103
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.803
I do get one thing, though.

104
00:07:18.803 --> 00:07:24.034
You and my Shin Woo are both the type
to get really hung up over their regrets.

105
00:07:26.652 --> 00:07:31.066
I mean, you said that you waited 10 years
without confessing to your first love!

106
00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:33.967
My Shin Woo is exactly the same way
when it comes to those things.

107
00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:37.799
You... knew that Shin Woo
liked someone?

108
00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:39.582
It'd be weird if I didn't know!

109
00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:41.364
I am his mother, after all!

110
00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:45.154
You know...

111
00:07:46.037 --> 00:07:48.488
it's the first time I've seen
Shin Woo act like this

112
00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:50.940
in the 18 years I've raised him.

113
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.065
He keeps waking up early every morning
even though I don't wake him up.

114
00:07:54.065 --> 00:07:56.681
So, one day, I followed him.

115
00:07:56.681 --> 00:08:01.573
And then, I saw him taking the bus
with this pretty little girl!

116
00:08:01.573 --> 00:08:06.243
I could tell just by watching him that
my Shin Woo's heart was racing!

117
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.940
Oh, my son!

118
00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:13.965
Goodness.

119
00:08:13.965 --> 00:08:16.657
After my husband
passed away early

120
00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:19.616
I got so busy with trying to
make a living, that I...

121
00:08:22.388 --> 00:08:27.222
wasn't really able to be there
all the time for my kids.

122
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:34.028
But still, even by hearing the sound of
my kids opening the door and coming in...

123
00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:41.231
I can tell if they're happy, sad,
tired, or if they need to poop.

124
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:42.803
I know exactly how they're feeling.

125
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.776
Oh, and you proved my son's innocence!

126
00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:55.035
And yet, I almost sent you away
without even properly thanking you.

127
00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:01.236
Instead of thanking me...

128
00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:04.523
just promise me one thing, ma'am.

129
00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:05.808
A promise?

130
00:09:05.808 --> 00:09:09.685
To be honest, the reason why I came
by today was to ask you this favor.

131
00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:13.212
Don't ask me why.

132
00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:15.985
You just have to do this for me, okay?

133
00:09:16.702 --> 00:09:18.140
No matter what happens.

134
00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:20.661
Sure.

135
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.242
You'll be getting a call
from your sister soon.

136
00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:28.651
And when you do...

137
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.864
you mustn't go to see her,
no matter what.

138
00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:35.856
You mean, my kids' aunt?

139
00:09:35.856 --> 00:09:36.986
You have to...

140
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.175
promise me this, okay?

141
00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.122
You mustn't go.

142
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.417
No matter what.

143
00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:15.776
Am I done doing everything
that needed to be done here, now?

144
00:10:23.626 --> 00:10:28.059
<i>You'll be getting a call
from your sister soon.</i>

145
00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:29.289
And when you do...

146
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.345
you mustn't go to meet her,
no matter what.

147
00:10:34.297 --> 00:10:36.266
<i>You mustn't go.</i>

148
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:38.343
<i>No matter what.</i>

149
00:10:45.054 --> 00:10:47.042
<i>Where are you going?</i>

150
00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:51.241
This won't be the last time
that I see you, right, Mr. Kang?

151
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:52.506
Let's make a promise...

152
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.042
to definitely meet again one day.

153
00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:00.858
<i>Give it one more try.</i>

154
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:03.746
This is...

155
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.869
Just trust me, and try
confessing one more time.

156
00:11:07.778 --> 00:11:09.015
<i>The end result of your first love</i>

I'm sure of it. Mr. Kang was
lying about his schooling.

193

That's why he left all of the sudden,

about his education.

last night, Ms. Baek?

Did you bite someone again?

I don't bite whenever I drink!

Then, they're probably
not even from Seoul!

00:16:38.443 --> 00:16:40.435
in a middle-of-nowhere town like this

234
00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:43.438
It's fine, as long as they
meet my other qualifications.

235

Qualifications?
Like what?

He's so cool when he does that!
Oh, Big Brother!

Hey!

No, I'm not going.

matched properly.

315
00:20:37.193 --> 00:20:39.286
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

316
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.524
Mom.

317
00:20:41.524 --> 00:20:44.697
Are interpersonal relationships
predetermined?

318
00:20:44.697 --> 00:20:45.947
Interpersonal relationships?

319
00:20:45.947 --> 00:20:49.636
I keep trying my best,
but things won't work out for me.

320
00:20:50.656 --> 00:20:54.084
So it's making me wonder if things are
just fated to not work out between us.

321
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:56.799
Ugh.

322
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.600
There's no such thing as a predetermined
interpersonal relationship

323
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.692
or an interpersonal relationship
that was doomed from the start.

324
00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:04.311
You have to take the chances that are
given to you to turn it into "fate."

325
00:21:04.311 --> 00:21:05.766
You may be fated to be together.

326
00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.616
But if you don't take the
chance that is given to you

327
00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:09.737
it'll just become a passing breeze.

328
00:21:10.348 --> 00:21:11.954
Oh, you.

329
00:21:11.954 --> 00:21:14.841
Why do you over-think things
so much when you're a guy?

330
00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:17.956
At this rate, you'll end up like
your homeroom teacher!

331
00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:20.107
Why are you bringing up
Mr. Kang all of the sudden?

332
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:23.510
<i>Be good to your mother.</i>

333
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.585
Pardon?

334
00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:25.599
You don't know, do you?

335
00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:28.837
That the reason why your mother is taking
medicine is because she has bad knees.

336
00:21:29.415 --> 00:21:30.633
What?

337
00:21:31.956 --> 00:21:33.106
Mom.

338
00:21:35.472 --> 00:21:37.158
Do you have bad knees, mom?

339
00:21:37.158 --> 00:21:39.966
How did you know?
Do you have x-ray vision?

340
00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.161
My homeroom teacher told me.

341
00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:43.960
How is it that Mr. Kang knows me
better than my own son?

342
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.398
Come to think of of it, there were
some things about him that were weird.

343
00:21:47.398 --> 00:21:49.646
He knows way too much about me.

344
00:21:49.646 --> 00:21:52.670
And sometimes, he acted as if
he knew what was going to happen.

345
00:21:53.963 --> 00:21:55.432
Maybe he's psychic?

346
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.339
Psychic?
Oh, as if!

347
00:21:58.339 --> 00:22:01.203
He's so kind and friendly.

348
00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:04.398
I'd have no other wish in the world
if you grew up to be like him!

349
00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:09.061
Oh, it's fine. You don't have to.
I'm sure your hands hurt.

350
00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:10.193
Just sit still.

351
00:22:11.855 --> 00:22:13.470
Want me to massage your
shoulders for you, too?

352
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.490
Could you please?

353
00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:18.381
- There we go.
- Oh, that feels great.

354
00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:20.375
- It does?
- Yeah.

355
00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:22.052
<i>[Ji Soo]</i>

356
00:22:30.917 --> 00:22:32.066
<i>Have you heard, Shin Woo?</i>

357
00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:35.768
So Ra told me that Ji Soo may
be leaving to study abroad.

358
00:22:35.768 --> 00:22:36.799
Study abroad?

359
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:39.516
You have to take the chances that are
given to you to turn it into "fate."

360
00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:40.665
You may be fated to be together.

361
00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:42.787
But if you don't take the
chance that is given to you

362
00:22:42.787 --> 00:22:44.897
it'll just become a passing breeze.

363
00:22:48.704 --> 00:22:49.867
Yeah.

364
00:22:49.867 --> 00:22:51.758
I don't care if we're fated to be or not.

365
00:22:51.758 --> 00:22:53.789
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

366
00:22:54.437 --> 00:22:58.766
I can't just let her go without
even giving it a shot.

367
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:05.591
<i>I have something to tell you, Ji Soo.</i>

368
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:09.098
<i>I'll wait for you at 1 o' clock
on Firefly Bridge.</i>

369
00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:12.333
<i>[Text Sent]</i>

370
00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:28.671
<i>It doesn't matter
what I call it</i>

371
00:23:28.671 --> 00:23:31.682
since it's not like
my feelings will change.

372
00:23:32.696 --> 00:23:35.843
Happy birthday, Mr. Kang.

373
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.094
Ji Soo!
Han Ji Soo!

374
00:23:50.266 --> 00:23:51.889
Mr. Kang.

375
00:23:55.324 --> 00:23:57.797
I'll leave this here.

376
00:23:58.869 --> 00:24:00.184
My feelings, I mean.

377
00:24:17.531 --> 00:24:19.014
Who could it be?

378
00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:32.038
<font color="E06287">[DramaFever Ver] E05 Longing Heart</font>
<font color="#7474C1">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

379
00:24:40.826 --> 00:24:42.261
Yeah, Big Sis?

380
00:24:43.995 --> 00:24:45.885
Are you sick?

381
00:24:46.367 --> 00:24:48.157
Yeah. I'll come over right now.

382
00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:49.300
If I leave now
and take the ferry...

383
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.410
<i>Please promise me one thing.</i>

384
00:24:52.474 --> 00:24:54.251
Don't ask me why.

385
00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:57.106
You just have to do this for me, okay?

386
00:24:57.691 --> 00:24:59.229
No matter what.

387
00:25:00.058 --> 00:25:01.233
All right.

388
00:25:03.973 --> 00:25:08.158
You'll be getting a call
from your sister soon.

389
00:25:08.158 --> 00:25:09.374
And when you do...

390
00:25:10.995 --> 00:25:13.428
you mustn't go to see her,
no matter what.

391
00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:15.449
You mean, my kids' aunt?

392
00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:18.465
You have to promise me this, okay?

393
00:25:28.975 --> 00:25:30.411
Big Sis.

394
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:35.298
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to come right now.

395
00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:39.162
Yeah, I'm sorry, Big Sis.
Take care of yourself, okay?

396
00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:45.245
How did Mr. Kang know
that I'd be getting this kind of call?

397
00:25:45.245 --> 00:25:46.393
<i>Hello?</i>

398
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.358
Yes?

399
00:25:50.412 --> 00:25:51.617
- Yes?
- Hello.

400
00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:53.178
- You're here?
- Yes.

401
00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:55.274
- It's a package for Shin Woo.
- I see.

402
00:25:55.274 --> 00:25:57.459
- Can you sign, please?
- Sure.

403
00:25:59.161 --> 00:26:01.374
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

404
00:26:04.936 --> 00:26:06.309
Did we get a package?

405
00:26:07.902 --> 00:26:10.037
Your citizen ID card is finally here.

406
00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:15.414
Oh, I was wondering when my son
would finally grow into a man.

407
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.098
And you're all grown now.

408
00:26:19.117 --> 00:26:20.490
Are you going somewhere?

409
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.493
Huh?
Yeah.

410
00:26:22.493 --> 00:26:24.451
I'm going to meet a friend.

411
00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:26.875
- I'll be going now.
- Wait, wait!

412
00:26:32.263 --> 00:26:33.557
Good luck.

413
00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:35.619
Huh? Um... what do you mean?

414
00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:37.240
I told you, I'm going to see a friend.

415
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.144
I'll be going now.

416
00:26:42.543 --> 00:26:44.395
Oh, yeah!

417
00:26:45.156 --> 00:26:48.375
Oh, I forgot to give him this.

418
00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:51.230
How could he go out to the
battlefield without any ammo?

419
00:26:53.252 --> 00:26:55.769
Did Shin Woo go somewhere, Mom?

420
00:26:55.769 --> 00:26:57.464
He said he was going to
meet up with a friend.

421
00:26:57.464 --> 00:26:59.366
Jeez, and I had something
to talk to him about, too.

422
00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:02.208
He's such an idiot, leaving
things like this lying around!

423
00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:06.667
This is his citizen ID card.

424
00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:09.376
I saw Shin Woo's homeroom teacher,
and he had this with him.

425
00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:11.956
But, do they reuse old cards to
make the new ones nowadays?

426
00:27:11.956 --> 00:27:14.296
Why does it look so worn
when it's brand new?

427
00:27:17.862 --> 00:27:21.308
But... Shin Woo's citizen ID card
arrived just now.

428
00:27:22.648 --> 00:27:24.868
So, why does Mr. Kang have this?

429
00:27:29.076 --> 00:27:31.292
- Mom!
- Oh, goodness!

430
00:27:32.497 --> 00:27:35.511
You can't go, no matter what, okay?

431
00:27:40.258 --> 00:27:41.853
<i>Do you have bad knees, mom?</i>

432
00:27:41.853 --> 00:27:43.406
<i>How did you know?</i>

433
00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:45.347
My homeroom teacher told me.

434
00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:48.039
How is it that Mr. Kang knows me
better than my own son?

435
00:27:48.039 --> 00:27:50.712
Come to think of of it, there were
some things about him that were weird.

436
00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:52.231
<i>He knows way too much about me.</i>

437
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:54.918
<i>And sometimes, he acted as if
he knew what was going to happen.</i>

438
00:28:04.777 --> 00:28:05.987
<i>[Ji Soo]</i>

439
00:28:08.828 --> 00:28:13.001
<i>This caller is unavailable.
Leave a message at the tone.</i>

440
00:28:13.786 --> 00:28:15.269
Did something happen to her?

441
00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:53.682
It was difficult to fix this.
Please don't drop it again.

442
00:28:53.682 --> 00:28:55.240
- It's all fixed now?
- Yes.

443
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.899
Thank you!
Here.

444
00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:08.811
Is it a habit of yours to
not know how to apologize?

445
00:29:09.624 --> 00:29:11.685
Oh my.
I'm oh-so-very sorry.

446
00:29:11.685 --> 00:29:16.081
Isn't there another person you
should apologize to, besides me?

447
00:29:16.081 --> 00:29:17.085
Who?

448
00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:18.443
I heard from everyone else.

449
00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:21.010
Everyone forgot about it since they
thought it was too boring to gossip about

450
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.119
but the person who smoked in
the bathroom that day was you.

451
00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:27.243
How could you walk around with your head
held high after framing Shin Woo for it?

452
00:29:27.243 --> 00:29:28.588
And you didn't apologize to him at all!

453
00:29:28.588 --> 00:29:29.632
What about you, then?

454
00:29:29.632 --> 00:29:31.233
Did you apologize to Kang Shin Woo?

455
00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:32.947
What?

456
00:29:32.947 --> 00:29:34.968
Oh, wait, no.

457
00:29:34.968 --> 00:29:37.924
Maybe what you shouldn't be
doing is apologizing

458
00:29:37.924 --> 00:29:39.231
but thanking him, instead.

459
00:29:39.231 --> 00:29:41.141
What... are you talking about?

460
00:29:41.141 --> 00:29:43.183
All right, I'll be up front with you.

461
00:29:43.183 --> 00:29:46.379
I didn't frame Kang Shin Woo
for the cigarette incident.

462
00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:48.506
He chose to take the blame for it.

463
00:29:48.506 --> 00:29:49.759
All because of you.

464
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.664
Hey, Go Sung Jin.

465
00:30:02.664 --> 00:30:04.444
Are you really going to sell this?

466
00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:07.799
Give me a decent price for it, please.

467
00:30:08.405 --> 00:30:11.266
What's gotten into you?
You love this thing.

468
00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:13.414
I was told that I'd die
while riding this.

469
00:30:13.414 --> 00:30:14.629
What?

470
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.287
You think I told you this
so that you could die?

471
00:30:17.287 --> 00:30:18.532
No, I'm telling you so that
you can avoid dying.

472
00:30:18.532 --> 00:30:19.874
How do you know something
that'll happen next year...

473
00:30:19.874 --> 00:30:21.853
Don't ask me how I know.

474
00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:25.560
You wouldn't get it even if I told you,
and I can't tell you anyway.

475
00:30:26.178 --> 00:30:30.770
If it makes you feel better,
my instincts have been quite off lately.

476
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.651
You saw how I was wrong
about Kang Shin Woo.

477
00:30:37.376 --> 00:30:38.405
Oh yeah.

478
00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:43.491
I've taken care of the cigarette
incident, more or less.

479
00:30:43.491 --> 00:30:46.086
Last time, you used an underhand
method to get your way

480
00:30:46.086 --> 00:30:47.731
but this time, this is a
chance that I'm giving to you.

481
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.910
It's up to you whether you want to make
the most of this chance, or waste it.

482
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.297
So, do your best.

483
00:30:53.297 --> 00:30:55.331
Why are you going to
such lengths for me?

484
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:57.837
I've developed some expectations,
after watching Kang Shin Woo.

485
00:30:57.837 --> 00:31:00.244
If a person can change...

486
00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:03.303
one's fate can probably change, too.

487
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.277
That kind of expectation.

488
00:31:05.277 --> 00:31:08.208
Jeez, who said such an unlucky thing?

489
00:31:09.183 --> 00:31:13.604
Oh, just a teacher
who isn't half-bad.

490
00:31:25.018 --> 00:31:26.624
<i>[September 30th, 2007]</i>

491
00:31:33.501 --> 00:31:35.160
Today is the day...

492
00:31:35.645 --> 00:31:36.885
of my mother's death.

493
00:31:42.796 --> 00:31:46.261
<i>I didn't frame Kang Shin Woo
for the cigarette incident.</i>

494
00:31:46.261 --> 00:31:48.213
<i>He chose to take on the blame.</i>

495
00:31:48.213 --> 00:31:49.383
<i>Because of you.</i>

496
00:31:50.017 --> 00:31:52.270
<i>Oh, I just had my reasons, is all.</i>

497
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.212
The best option would've been to have
this settled after I got a beating.

498
00:31:55.896 --> 00:31:58.028
<i>He said that he's leaving
early in the morning.</i>

499
00:31:58.028 --> 00:32:00.653
And I thought that
you'd want to see him.

500
00:32:01.465 --> 00:32:03.245
<i>Tell me something else, too.</i>

501
00:32:04.274 --> 00:32:05.709
<i>After all...</i>

502
00:32:06.293 --> 00:32:08.703
you need someone to
lend you an ear right now.

503
00:32:13.858 --> 00:32:17.234
<i>I have something to tell you, Ji Soo.</i>

504
00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:20.413
<i>I'll wait for you at Firefly Bridge
at 1 o' clock tomorrow.</i>

505
00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:22.995
<i>So look deep into your heart and
figure out who it is that you truly like.</i>

506
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.686
<i>Because, when you do...</i>

507
00:33:27.347 --> 00:33:29.543
<i>this part of you, right here,
will send you a signal.</i>

508
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.491
You were here like this,
this entire time?

509
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:43.087
You should've gone home
if I didn't send you a reply!

510
00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:45.203
Or you could've asked me
to reschedule with you!

511
00:33:45.203 --> 00:33:47.132
Why did you stay here, like this?

512
00:33:47.132 --> 00:33:48.951
But, it's because
I was here, like this...

513
00:33:49.684 --> 00:33:51.864
that you ended up
coming in the end.

514
00:33:54.876 --> 00:33:57.374
You must be cold.
Let's go somewhere else.

515
00:34:04.857 --> 00:34:07.481
What is it...
that you wanted to tell me?

516
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:10.405
What?

517
00:34:10.405 --> 00:34:12.216
The thing you wanted to tell me.

518
00:34:13.328 --> 00:34:14.694
What was it?

519
00:34:26.749 --> 00:34:30.383
<i>Could people's fates
really change...</i>

520
00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:34.923
<i>when situations change,
and people change?</i>

521
00:34:35.424 --> 00:34:36.656
<i>Hello?</i>

522
00:34:36.656 --> 00:34:38.897
Yes, hello.
I'm Shin Woo's homeroom teacher.

523
00:34:39.598 --> 00:34:41.801
His mother is home right now, correct?

524
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:43.328
Oh, Mom headed out.

525
00:34:43.328 --> 00:34:45.450
Um... where did she go?

526
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:47.299
<i>She said she was
going to see you.</i>

527
00:34:47.299 --> 00:34:49.642
You said you were going to a
hospital off the island yesterday.

528
00:34:49.642 --> 00:34:51.464
So she went to take the ferry.

529
00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:54.091
N-no.
No.

530
00:34:54.787 --> 00:34:55.792
<i>What?</i>

531
00:34:55.792 --> 00:34:57.075
We have to hurry.

532
00:34:57.075 --> 00:34:59.341
We have to hurry!
There's going to be an accident!

533
00:34:59.935 --> 00:35:01.006
No!

534
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.622
<i>[Kang Shin Woo]</i>

535
00:35:05.033 --> 00:35:09.202
<i>This time, will I be able to stop fate...</i>

536
00:35:10.462 --> 00:35:11.977
<i>which is escaping...</i>

537
00:35:12.854 --> 00:35:14.866
<i>through my fingers,
like the wind?</i>

538
00:35:21.691 --> 00:35:23.015
Just a moment.

539
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.780
Hello?

540
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.522
Where are you right now,
Kang Shin Woo?

541
00:35:27.522 --> 00:35:28.685
Mr. Kang?

542
00:35:28.685 --> 00:35:30.173
I asked you where you are right now!

543
00:35:30.173 --> 00:35:32.549
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

544
00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:33.827
Mom...

545
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.796
Mom is in danger.

546
00:35:36.446 --> 00:35:37.531
<i>Pardon?</i>

547
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:40.080
Our mom is in danger!

548
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.988
"Our mom?"

549
00:35:44.988 --> 00:35:46.307
What's going on?

550
00:35:47.234 --> 00:35:48.644
What happened to your mom?

551
00:35:48.644 --> 00:35:49.707
It's nothing.

552
00:35:50.604 --> 00:35:52.314
But I think I have to go now.

553
00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.825
Let's talk about this again later,
after I go take care of this.

554
00:35:57.825 --> 00:35:59.245
I'll call you.

555
00:36:00.039 --> 00:36:02.423
Shin Woo!
Shin Woo!

556
00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:06.236
I just...

557
00:36:06.736 --> 00:36:08.694
saw your mom,
not too long ago.

558
00:36:12.868 --> 00:36:15.819
Mr. Kang!
Why are you still...

559
00:36:15.819 --> 00:36:17.276
I'm going to borrow this for a bit.

560
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.153
Wait!

561
00:36:20.138 --> 00:36:21.901
Mr. Kang!

562
00:36:27.756 --> 00:36:29.611
Get in, Kang Shin Woo!

563
00:36:36.218 --> 00:36:38.385
You were here this whole time, Mr. Kang?

564
00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:40.017
Something came up.

565
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:43.631
But, what happened
to your mother, Mr. Kang?

566
00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:45.057
Did something happen to her?

567
00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:46.876
She was in an accident
10 years ago.

568
00:36:46.876 --> 00:36:49.756
There was a huge accident
in which a ferry boat sank.

569
00:36:49.756 --> 00:36:52.883
What does an accident from ten
years ago have to do with now?

570
00:36:52.883 --> 00:36:54.807
That day from ten years ago is today

571
00:36:54.807 --> 00:36:57.615
and our mom was on
that ferry that sank.

572
00:36:59.127 --> 00:37:00.341
What do you mean...

573
00:37:04.406 --> 00:37:05.642
What is this?

574
00:37:05.642 --> 00:37:06.935
A cellphone from
10 years in the future.

575
00:37:06.935 --> 00:37:09.805
Put your hand on it.
It'll only unlock with my fingerprint.

576
00:37:12.977 --> 00:37:16.055
You said that this only unlocks
with your fingerprint, Mr. Kang.

577
00:37:16.055 --> 00:37:17.225
So why is this unlocking
with my fingerprint...

578
00:37:17.225 --> 00:37:18.473
Because it's the same fingerprint.

579
00:37:19.252 --> 00:37:20.356
What?

580
00:37:20.356 --> 00:37:24.537
You still don't understand
who I really am, Kang Shin Woo?

581
00:37:26.863 --> 00:37:29.232
<i>Um, not me, but my mother...</i>

582
00:37:29.232 --> 00:37:31.816
Hey, you punk! Despite everything,
I never sold out my mom!

583
00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:34.363
How dare you do that
to our mom, you bastard!

584
00:37:34.363 --> 00:37:37.774
Because of you, I've only come to
realize so many things just now!

585
00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:41.352
And because of that, I'm filled with
more regret and remorse than you!

586
00:37:41.352 --> 00:37:43.372
Shin Woo didn't do it.
I know this for a fact.

587
00:37:43.372 --> 00:37:46.046
He definitely wasn't the one
who did this.

588
00:37:46.046 --> 00:37:47.756
<i>I told you, I definitely heard him
say with his own mouth</i>

589
00:37:47.756 --> 00:37:50.461
that he graduated from our high school!

590
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:53.196
<i>But I can't find his name
or photo anywhere!</i>

591
00:37:53.196 --> 00:37:55.222
Could you be...

592
00:37:57.845 --> 00:37:59.303
No way, this can't be.

593
00:37:59.874 --> 00:38:01.836
- This can't be...
- Oh, but it can.

594
00:38:01.836 --> 00:38:03.142
It can.

595
00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:05.584
I'm right in front of you
right now, after all.

596
00:38:05.584 --> 00:38:08.622
I'm the 28-year-old version of you,
from 10 years in the future.

597
00:38:09.274 --> 00:38:11.732
Then, our mom right now is...

598
00:38:11.732 --> 00:38:13.151
I tried to stop it.

599
00:38:13.752 --> 00:38:15.551
But things ended up
this way again.

600
00:38:17.133 --> 00:38:20.839
You'll get to see this face as much as
you want in the mirror, in ten years.

601
00:38:21.443 --> 00:38:23.115
So focus on praying
right now instead.

602
00:38:23.651 --> 00:38:25.479
Pray that things will end up
differently this time.

603
00:38:38.131 --> 00:38:40.363
Has the 2 o' clock ferry left?

604
00:38:40.363 --> 00:38:42.341
Yes, it left on time.

605
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:43.497
No.

606
00:38:44.118 --> 00:38:46.852
You have to stop them!
Call them and stop that boat, right now!

607
00:38:46.852 --> 00:38:47.944
Pardon?

608
00:38:47.944 --> 00:38:50.189
That ferry will be involved
in an accident soon!

609
00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:51.859
- Hurry up and stop it! Hurry!
- Yes, this is the ferry office.

610
00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:52.988
Pardon?

611
00:38:54.187 --> 00:38:55.530
I think there's been an accident.

612
00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.997
- What?
- What's going on?

613
00:38:56.997 --> 00:38:58.638
What happened?

614
00:38:58.638 --> 00:39:00.310
Why are you all panicked?

615
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.098
Another boat has crashed into our ferry!

616
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:04.861
Yes.

617
00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:07.832
No!

618
00:39:10.466 --> 00:39:11.658
Please stay back!

619
00:39:11.658 --> 00:39:13.587
- Goodness!
- Where are you going?

620
00:39:17.062 --> 00:39:18.781
I can't let this happen.

621
00:39:20.432 --> 00:39:22.115
I can't let things
end this way again.

622
00:39:22.115 --> 00:39:23.682
It's possible that it could
be different this time.

623
00:39:24.546 --> 00:39:27.234
It's possible that Mom didn't
take that boat this time!

624
00:39:28.082 --> 00:39:29.446
No.

625
00:39:30.328 --> 00:39:31.671
I know she was.

626
00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:34.216
There was only that one ferry.

627
00:39:35.318 --> 00:39:36.720
Things are exactly
the same as that day.

628
00:39:41.405 --> 00:39:43.202
What are you planning to do?

629
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.868
I can't just let her go like
this for a second time!

630
00:39:48.312 --> 00:39:49.885
Mr. Kang!

631
00:40:02.127 --> 00:40:03.470
<i>Why now?</i>

632
00:40:04.222 --> 00:40:05.678
<i>Why here?</i>

633
00:40:05.678 --> 00:40:07.075
<i>Why?</i>

634
00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:29.711
I need to make you a coupon
and give you stamps on it, Mr. Kang!

635
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:31.787
I've been running this place
for ten years now

636
00:40:31.787 --> 00:40:34.437
and it's the first time
I've ever had a regular like you.

637
00:40:34.437 --> 00:40:37.542
To me, this food right here is the most
delicious food in the whole world.

638
00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.350
Oh, thank you so much.

639
00:40:40.961 --> 00:40:43.589
I just stir-fried these,
Mr. Kang. Try it.

640
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:47.252
Oh, I'm sorry, but I have a nut allergy.

641
00:40:47.252 --> 00:40:49.084
- Really?
- Yes.

642
00:40:49.084 --> 00:40:50.711
You're exactly like our Shin Woo
in that way, too!

643
00:40:50.711 --> 00:40:53.022
I mean, your names
are the same.

644
00:40:53.022 --> 00:40:56.299
And your faces look
kind of similar, too!

645
00:40:56.299 --> 00:40:57.718
Are you all right?

646
00:40:57.718 --> 00:40:59.676
Shin Hee!
Bring us some water!

647
00:40:59.676 --> 00:41:01.647
- Are you all right?
- Um, yes.

648
00:41:02.899 --> 00:41:04.174
Hey, Shin Hee.

649
00:41:04.174 --> 00:41:05.234
Take a look at Mr. Kang.

650
00:41:05.234 --> 00:41:08.044
Doesn't he look just like our Shin Woo?

651
00:41:13.077 --> 00:41:14.129
Which part?

652
00:41:14.129 --> 00:41:16.176
You mean how he has two eyes,
one nose, and one mouth?

653
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:19.417
Jeez, she can be so harsh.

654
00:41:19.975 --> 00:41:22.343
- Enjoy!
- All right. Thank you.

655
00:41:27.323 --> 00:41:30.368
Is she really my one and
only blood-related sister?

656
00:41:30.368 --> 00:41:31.383
Ugh.

657
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.941
Huh?
Mr. Kang?

658
00:41:39.354 --> 00:41:40.354
Huh?

659
00:41:49.296 --> 00:41:51.048
Be good to your mother.

660
00:41:51.048 --> 00:41:52.200
Pardon?

661
00:41:52.694 --> 00:41:53.955
You didn't know, did you?

662
00:41:53.955 --> 00:41:57.365
That the reason why your mother is taking
medicine is because she has bad knees.

663
00:41:57.962 --> 00:41:59.191
My mom is?

664
00:41:59.191 --> 00:42:01.477
How did you know that, Mr. Kang?

665
00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:04.444
These things become really obvious
when you become an adult.

666
00:42:04.444 --> 00:42:06.669
I only found this out about my
own mother after she passed away

667
00:42:06.669 --> 00:42:08.517
and I was going through
her belongings.

668
00:42:08.517 --> 00:42:10.566
And I saw the same medication
at your mother's store.

669
00:42:14.155 --> 00:42:15.917
I won!

670
00:42:15.917 --> 00:42:18.071
Aw, come on!
What was that?

671
00:42:18.071 --> 00:42:19.573
You lied about that just now, didn't you?

672
00:42:19.573 --> 00:42:20.629
Hey, you punk!

673
00:42:20.629 --> 00:42:22.756
I'm not like you, who uses
his mother in his lies!

674
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.410
At any rate, I won.

675
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.540
So help your mom with the
store until it closes, okay?

676
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.423
This is not fair.
Let's play one more round.

677
00:42:29.423 --> 00:42:31.095
This is our fifth game already!

678
00:42:32.423 --> 00:42:34.720
All right, fine.
I'll hear you out.

679
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.832
What did you want
if you were to win, anyway?

680
00:42:35.832 --> 00:42:37.314
Can I be honest?

681
00:42:37.314 --> 00:42:38.385
Yeah.

682
00:42:39.287 --> 00:42:42.410
I want to hit you like
this, just once.

683
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.319
- Oh, you!
- Ow!

684
00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:47.622
You really are the type that
deserves to get hit.

685
00:42:47.622 --> 00:42:48.760
Ugh.

686
00:42:51.937 --> 00:42:54.530
Hey, hey, get up.
Get up.

687
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.209
- Get up!
- Ow! Ow!

688
00:42:56.209 --> 00:42:57.357
Ow! Mom! The teacher is... ow!

689
00:42:57.357 --> 00:42:58.827
- Give that to me, ma'am!
- Why?

690
00:42:58.827 --> 00:43:00.269
- I'll do it.
- It's okay!

691
00:43:00.269 --> 00:43:02.604
- No, I can do it.
- It's fine. Shin Woo? Do it.

692
00:43:02.604 --> 00:43:04.169
Sweep.
Sweep here!

693
00:43:04.962 --> 00:43:06.055
Hurry up and sweep this!

694
00:43:06.055 --> 00:43:08.149
- He's not the type who'd do it.
- It's okay, ma'am.

695
00:43:08.149 --> 00:43:09.615
It's all right.
He has to do it.

696
00:43:09.615 --> 00:43:11.211
- Work hard, then!
- Hey, here!

697
00:43:11.211 --> 00:43:12.660
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up and do this!

698
00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.055
Wow, how cool!

699
00:43:14.055 --> 00:43:16.319
- Goodness, look at him.
- Hey, Kang Shin Woo!

700
00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:18.212
All right, I'll do it!

701

703
00:43:33.363 --> 00:43:36.185
- Give that to me, ma'am!

704
00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:38.066
- I'll do it.
- It's okay!

Oh gosh.

706
00:43:40.015 --> 00:43:41.959
Doesn't it feel like our ears
are getting clogged up?

707
00:43:41.959 --> 00:43:43.955
No, no.
Right now is fine.

708
00:43:46.868 --> 00:43:48.426
There we go!
Oh!

709
00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:49.609
Where are you shooting that from?

710
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:50.950
Wait.

711
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:52.901
- Whoa!
- Wait, wait!

712
00:43:52.901 --> 00:43:54.209
Oh, this isn't right!

713
00:43:54.209 --> 00:43:55.318
There we go.

714
00:43:55.318 --> 00:43:56.857
I used to play the crane machine
games when I was young.

715
00:43:56.857 --> 00:43:59.629
- Oh, crane machines?
- Let's roll!

716
00:43:59.629 --> 00:44:01.687
All right, go!

717
00:44:01.687 --> 00:44:03.597
I won!

718
00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:05.785
What?
What was that?

719
00:44:05.785 --> 00:44:06.798
What you just said
was a lie, right?

720
00:44:06.798 --> 00:44:07.836
- Cut!
- Cue!

721
00:44:19.486 --> 00:44:21.104
Cut, Shin Woo.
Okay.

722
00:44:21.104 --> 00:44:22.258
Cue!

723
00:44:24.723 --> 00:44:26.162
Oh no!

724
00:44:27.142 --> 00:44:28.830
- Cut!
- What's wrong?

725
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.314
I'm so sorry!

726
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.278
Ow!

727
00:44:36.238 --> 00:44:38.015
Ow!
Ow!

728
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.106
- Cut.
- Cut!

729
00:44:40.106 --> 00:44:41.171
Oh gosh.

730
00:44:41.801 --> 00:44:42.836
What do you think is in there?

731
00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:44.345
A box.
A box.

732
00:44:44.345 --> 00:44:45.566
- Just a box.
- Shall we do it over?

733
00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:50.589
The bag!
Cue!

734
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.376
Ow!
Ow!

735
00:44:53.376 --> 00:44:54.707
Ow!

736
00:44:55.298 --> 00:44:56.794
Who the hell did that?

737
00:44:57.341 --> 00:44:58.924
Who the hell did that?

738
00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:18.272
I'll do it now.

739
00:45:18.272 --> 00:45:19.852
- Let's do it!
- All right, I'll do it now.

740
00:45:19.852 --> 00:45:21.678
- All right, let's go!
- Go!

741
00:45:22.294 --> 00:45:23.696
Ready?
Action!

742
00:45:34.433 --> 00:45:35.435
Mister!

743
00:45:35.435 --> 00:45:37.075
What are you doing?
That's dangerous!

744
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:39.348
Mister!

745
00:45:40.203 --> 00:45:42.082
What year is this?

746
00:45:42.082 --> 00:45:45.944
I'm not merely tired right now.

747
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.269
I might actually just die.

748
00:45:49.836 --> 00:45:51.696
It honestly feels like
ice water in there.

749
00:45:55.457 --> 00:45:57.506
Thank you, everyone!
